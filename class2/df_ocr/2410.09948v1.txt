ABSTRACT

Kenya, known for its linguistic diversity, faces unique challenges and promising opportunities in
advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, particularly for its underrepresented
indigenous languages. This survey provides a detailed assessment of the current state of NLP in
Kenya, emphasizing ongoing efforts in dataset creation, machine translation, sentiment analysis,
and speech recognition for local dialects such as Kiswahili, Dholuo, Kikuyu, and Luhya. Despite
these advancements, the development of NLP in Kenya remains constrained by limited resources and
tools, resulting in the underrepresentation of most indigenous languages in digital spaces. This paper
uncovers significant gaps by critically evaluating the available datasets and existing NLP models,
most notably the need for large-scale language models and the insufficient digital representation of
Indigenous languages. We also analyze key NLP applications—machine translation, information
retrieval, and sentiment analysis—examining how they are tailored to address local linguistic needs.
Furthermore, the paper explores the governance, policies, and regulations shaping the future of AI
and NLP in Kenya and proposes a strategic roadmap to guide future research and development
efforts. Our goal is to provide a foundation for accelerating the growth of NLP technologies that
meet Kenya’s diverse linguistic demands.

1 Introduction

The last few years have seen an explosion in the number of Natural Language Processing(NLP) applications and
tools. Tools such as chatGPT are now ubiquitous in many aspects of our lives. NLP subfield of artificial intelligence
(AD) that seeks to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Although there have been
significant advances in the field of NLP, most of the research today focuses on less than 1% of the world’s languages

with a particular focus on ten or so languages, including English (2020); (2019). One of the

main challenges of NLP, especially in low-resource settings, is the availability of requisite datasets to train models in
low-resource languages. This is a big issue regarding the progress of NLP for low-resource languages |Siminyu et al
(2021): [Ruder and Korashy (2019). With the increasing number of research interests in NLP globally, multiple efforts
have emerged in Africa to create both NLP tools and datasets that power NLP technology, reflecting the continent’s
drive toward AI democratization while addressing concerns about digital colonization|Etor; et all and the need
for locally grounded solutions.

Africa is one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world, with an estimated 3,000 languages spoken across
the continent. However, efforts to forge cohesive nation-states from multiple ethnic groups have often resulted in the
marginalization of several languages. Priority has typically been given to high-resource languages such as English and
French, alongside regional or national languages like Kiswahili and Afrikaans|Adebara 024). Yan and Xu (Ined-b.
While these dominant languages are widely spoken, millions of Africans communicate in at least three languages,
including one or two national and indigenous languages. Unfortunately, many of these indigenous languages remain
underrepresented in the digital space despite their prevalence.

In Kenya, there has been limited progress in mapping the country’s languages and developing digital tools to support
them, particularly for the indigenous languages spoken by millions. This highlights the need for a comprehensive
assessment of the current state of NLP technologies in Kenya, considering its diverse geographical and linguistic
contexts. Many of these languages remain underrepresented in digital spaces, underscoring the urgency for targeted
efforts to bridge this gap and accurately reflect NLP advancements in the region.

Kenya is made up of multilingual communities. First, it is important to distinguish the difference between tribes and
languages. A widely cited but controversial number is the 42 tribes. One would expect, therefore, that Kenya would
have about 42 languages based on the tribes. However, the total number of tribes in Kenya is not well researched,
neither are there clear distinctions on what is a tribe. According to ethnology (2005), there are about
68 spoken languages in Kenya today. Most of the research attempts to study language groups instead of individual
languages. Kenyan languages are generally fall into 3 groups; Bantu, Nilotic and Cushitic. Table[I]shows the most
widely spoken languages in their language groups. With a population of 50 million and growing, doubled by a
recent emergence of language and culture appreciation, the roadmap in this paper provides a path towards digital
representation for this population.

Some efforts have started in Kenya to collect, clean and organise language datasets in several indigenous languages.
These datasets have already been used to develop NLP tools in several of Kenyans languaged]]. With this backdrop,
this paper surveys on the state of NLP in Kenya, aiming to highlight ongoing work and bring out the challenges and

'We highlight such efforts in subsequent sections of the paper

opportunities in the field. As these efforts continue, it is important to record and map them and create a road map for
the future. This survey is an initial attempt at this.

To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first attempt to consolidate all efforts by researchers, practitioners and
linguists and provide a reference point for NLP research in Kenya. It is also the first major attempt to map Kenyan
languages from an NLP perspective and provide an initial perspective of a prospective research road map for NLP
research in Kenya. While the field of NLP is very broad and keeps growing, we aim to cover as many subtopics are
possible.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows; first, we look at similar surveys and works in Section[2] In Section
[4], we survey all datasets on Kenyan languages. In section[5}we survey NLP applications developed in Kenya or using
kenyan languages. We touch on categories of applications such as machine translations, information retrieval, and text
classification. In section [6] we look at governance, policies and regulations related to AI and NLP specifically. We
highlight different efforts by governments and communities to draft AI policies and regulations around the technology.
Finally in section[8]we discuss a possible roadmap for NLP research in Kenya.

2 Related Work
The systematic review by|Chesire and Kipkebuti (2024) highlights an expanding corpus of research in dataset creation,

machine translation, and the development of multilingual pretrained models tailored for African languages. Prominent
initiatives include the development of datasets such as MASAKHANEWS, which facilitates news classification in 16
African languages (2023b), and AfriSenti, designed for sentiment analysis across 14 African languages
(2023a). Advancements in machine translation are evident, with models like AfriByTS{Adelani et all
(2022) and MMTAfrica catering to the linguistic diversity of the continent. Nonetheless,
the authors point out that the African NLP landscape still confronts considerable hurdles, chiefly the dearth of extensive
datasets and a limited number of NLP researchers within the region.

assess the Afrocentric NLP for the African languages. In their paper, they explore

the linguistic diversity of African languages and their distinct challenges for NLP, including tonal systems, vowel har-
mony, and serial verb constructions. It emphasizes that these linguistic traits are underrepresented in most mainstream
NLP languages, underscoring the necessity for specialized methodologies tailored to African languages. Furthermore,
the paper sheds light on various sociopolitical factors, such as national language policies that prioritize foreign lan-
guages, low literacy rates in indigenous languages with individuals often only literate in foreign tongues, and the
absence of standardized orthographies or the presence of inconsistent spelling norms, all of which add complexity to
text processing and analysis. These issues profoundly affect the advancement of NLP for African languages.

There have been attempts to survey the state of NLP in Africa from regional and country-specific perspectives. From a
regional perspective, the study by(Mussandi and Wichert discusses some of the opportunities and challenges of
building technologies for languages of African origin in their survey on NLP tools for African languages. It features
corpora and task-specific language models developed by previous studies for these languages, exposing the scarcity of
these NLP tools that contribute to African languages’ ‘technological delay’. AI4D - Artificial Intelligence for Develop-
ment initiative|Siminyu et al! noted the technological gap created by lack of datasets in African languages. This
initiative, aimed at creating datasets for African languages through crowd-sourcing data, reported the setbacks of cre-
ating data resources for these languages. review NLP approaches for low-resource languages
touching on issues that affect African languages, where most are low-resource.

From country specific perspectives,|Azunre et al] in their study on the state of NLP in Ghana highlight some of
the efforts of NLP Ghana in developing data sources and language tools for Ghaninan languages that are considered
low-resource. Some of their contributions such as building annotated datasets, embedding models and translators
and for most-widely spoken languages in Ghana are aimed at increasing availability of language resources for these
languages. (2020) highlights the South African NLP landscape, zooming into the existing disparity when it
comes to availability of language content in the various South African languages on Wikipedia. The study also looks
at past experiences of language processing for South African languages and paints a way forward for African NLP
through community building.

3 Methodology

This research follows a multi-step approach encompassing data collection, analysis of existing models, and evaluation
of available resources for Kenyan languages to assess the current state of NLP technologies in Kenya. Our methods


State of NLP in Kenya: A Survey A PREPRINT

involved reviewing locally and internationally published research and datasets, as long as they incorporated Kenyan
languages, ensuring a comprehensive analysis.

We gathered relevant data by extensively reviewing publicly available datasets, research papers from Google Scholar,
ACL, etc., and NLP tools. We focused on Kenyan languages such as Swahili, Dholuo, and Luhya. Our survey included
datasets for text classification, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering.

Lastly, we compared the available datasets and models with Kenya’s languages and identified significant gaps in data
availability and technological adaptation. Our comparison followed a structured approach focused on five key areas:
language coverage, NLP tasks, NLP tools , NLP application tasks, and resource availability. We assessed the
representation of Kenyan languages in available datasets. The datasets were analyzed using the application of NLP
tasks. We examined the practical application of these tools in functions such as translation and speech recognition.
Lastly, we compared the availability of computational resources, including annotated datasets and pre-trained models,
across Kenyan languages, identifying critical gaps.

State of NLP in Kenya: A Survey A PREPRINT

5.1 Machine Translation

Rule-Based approach: This is one of the earliest methods in the field based on a deep understanding of the linguistic
properties of both source and target languages. It combines expert-crafted grammar rules and dictionaries, focusing on
specific linguistic aspects such as morphology, syntax, and lexical semantics. All Kenyan languages are still considered
low-resource; thus, they do not have curated grammar rules for rule-based machine translation. on the other hand, all
languages listed in Table[I]have available dictionaries onlind™, Collectively, even with these resources, are few to no
publicly available rule based MT models for Kenyan languages.

Statistical Machine Translation: This approach employs statistical techniques such as probability models to fa-
cilitate translation between source and target languages. This approach is based on the analysis of large corpora of
bilingual text data, where the system learns how words, phrases and sentences in one language correspond to those in
another language. It assigns probability scores to words or phrases in each target sentence, with those scoring highest
considered the best translations. De Pauw et al. P% developed a Swahili-English Statistical Machine translation system

Neural Machine Translation: This approach is currently regarded as the state of art in the field as it has shown
improved performance compared to the other techniques. It employs deep learning techniques to infer high-level
semantics from language translations. A prominent method in this approach is the transformer-based model with
encoder-decoder architecture introduced by Vashwan et al.(2017) Many African languages including Kenyan lan-
guages have not benefited from these developments as parallel data is scarce for these languages. However, there
have been several efforts to build NMT models or include them in multilingual MT models. We will break this down
according to the various languages:

1. Swahili: This stands as the most resourced language in Kenya, prominently featured in both national and
international contexts. Several models cover Swahili, namely: bilingual model, multilingual model, fine-
tuned models.

Bilingual Models
¢ Rogendo’s English-Swahili Model: Available at Hugging Face, this model represents a key resource for
English-Swahili translatio

¢ HPLT’s Swahili-English Model: Trained using data from OPUS and HPLT, this model facilitates Swahili
to English translation?4.

¢ Helsinki’s English-Swahili and Finnish-Swahili Models: These models are part of Helsinki-NLP’s offer-
ings, demonstrating a broader linguistic reac

¢ Masakhane English-Swahili models: These models are found on GitHub and form part of the machine
translation for Africa project.

Multilingual Models
¢ NLLB, MMTAfrica, m2m-100: These models incorporate Swahili as part of their multilingual capa-
bilities, highlighting the language’s significant presence in global language models.

2. Kikuyu: Integrated into the NLLB model, and subsequent fine-tuning efforts. Additionally, a Swahili-Kikuyu
translation model is hosted on GitHut?>, along with a Masakhane’s English-Kikuyu model.

3. Kamba: Similarly to Kikuyu, included in both NLLB and Masakhane’s models available on GitHub.

4. Luo: Featured in multilingual models like NLLB and specific bilingual models by Helsinki-NLA™4.

5. Luhya: Despite available parallel datasets, there are no publicly available machine translation models for
Luhya.

6. Somali, Oromo, Maasai, Nandi (Kalenjin): Included in the MADLAD-400 model, with Oromo supported by
Helsinki’s bilingual models and Somali featured in NLLB.

7. Gusii, Meru, Giriama/Mijikenda, Turkana, Borana, Orma: No models are publicly available for these lan-
guages.

Closed MT Systems There are several closed machine translation systems that feature Kenya languages. Namely:
Namely: Google Translate features Swahili and Oromo, machinetranslate.org features Swahili, Kikuyu, Kamba, So-
mali and Oromo, rephrasely features Kikuyu.

5.2 Information Retrieval

Information retrieval is still an underexplored task in the Kenyan context. We see the growing research initiatives such

as Masakhand>|, and the advancement of deep learning methodologies such as transfer learning help in building new
African datasets by adapting existing multilingual pretrained models in high-resource languases|Osucitet al] (021):
(suns tall 029 ha promote improving natural language processing and information retrieval for African
languages (20234): (2023). However, these previously mentioned works only cover

Swahili, leaving opportunity for exploration for the rest of the Kenya languages.

5.3 Text Classification
5.3.1 Sentiment analysis

In this subsection, we review of the state of sentiment analysis in Kenya.

Sentiment analysis for Kenyan languages has been explored limitedly in multilingual settings. For instance,
Muhammad et al! (2023a) collected Afrisenti geographically distributed over the African continent and included
Oromo and Kiswahili, spoken in Kenya. Other sentiment analysis applications in Africa documented include Sen-

timentr[Cannon et al) (2022) , VADERBotchway et al. and NVIVO IIOchieng (2017).

Although limited below are some sentiment analysis applications developed for the Kenyan context.

¢ The mapping of sentiment of the Government of Kenya’s state service, Huduma Kenya|Ng’ ang’ ira (2018).
Ng’angira develops a prototype system to obtain, preprocess and make inferences about public sentiment
on government services. For a use case, Ng’angira tests the system on 8001 tweets; 3307, 2658 and 2036
positive and neutral respectively.

Sauer et al have analysed the Kenyan public’s reaction to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
(2022). This is a project by China for the building of large scale infrastructure in 150 countries
in Africa, Middle and Far East and Europe. In Kenya, the flagship project of the BRI is the Standard Gauge
Railway (SGR). The Authors use VADER to analyse a set of multilingual tweets in English and Kiswahili con-
stituting a commentary corpus on the SGR. For Kiswahili, the authors first translate the tweets into English
then carry the sentiment analysis on the English translation. For error analysis, 200 tweets were randomly
sampled for each language and sentiment class. While there’s a worry that there could be an error amplifi-
cation from translation, the author’s demonstrate that the Swahili and English error rates do not demonstrate
significant divergences.

Moge Noor analyses sentiment reaction to 1122 tweets on the Demonetisation of legal tender using multino-

mial naive Bayes classificationNoon (2020).

Evanega et al on the other hand compare the attitudes in Kenya and other African countries (Uganda, Nigeria)
towards the introduction of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) in the country (2022).
From a baseline of around 67% positive or neutral views towards GMO, there has been a slight increase

towards positive attitudes towards GMO. They show that this level is relatively stable from January 2018 to
December 2020.

developed a model to analyse sentiment of demonetization in Kenya. The data was retrieved
from twitter using a web scraper with the help of advanced search. The data was collected between June
and October , 1128 tweets collected. Some techniques for data processing were used to reduce noise and
dimensionality in the data. The SA was performed using the Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm and the
development of lexicon analysis which contains a word list that is negative and positive. For model evaluation,
the author used a confusion matrix to summarize the performance of the prediction and its results.To validate
the results, precision,recall and accuracy was used. The overall score maintained was an accuracy of 0.704.

° (2015) used sentiment analysis to help with identification, detection and tracking of terrorists activities
in a more timely manner. Data was collected from twitter where the analysis was done. To accomplish
the analysis ,analyst must have real time access to incident reports and make information scanning a daily
process.

° (2015) carried out mapping of sentiments, which is the process of linking classified tweets

and geocoordinates.

5.4 Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR)

There is a significant opportunity to create and expand datasets and applications in local languages and dialects to im-
prove the accuracy of ASR. Increased collaboration between local universities, research institutions, and international
organizations can accelerate advancements in ASR technology. ASR technology can be applied in public service sec-
tors such as education, healthcare, and government to improve accessibility and efficiency. Encouraging local startups
to innovate in the ASR space can lead to the development of tailored solutions that address specific regional needs
(2022). However, as it stand, there are limited ASR applications for Kenyan languages.

5.5 Named Entity Recognition

We detail NER contributions in Kenya in this subsection:

The Swahili NER dataset is a Named _ Entity Recognition (NER) dataset generated from
https://huggingface.co/datasets/swahili using back-translation techniques. This data has been cleaned using a
couple of techniques and is ready for training a Spacy NER model without any modifications, with this data one is
able to train a swahili-spacy-ner contributing to the NER space in Kenya.

Another application of NER is the Analysis of a machine learning-based algorithm used in name entity recognition.
The work analysed various machine learning algorithms and implemented KNN which has been widely used in ma-
chine learning and remains one of the most popular methods to classify data. It was established by the researchers
that no published study has presented Named entity recognition for the Kikuyu language using a machine learning
algorithm. This research will fill this gap by recognising entities in the Kikuyu language. An evaluation was done by
testing precision, recall, and F-measure. The experiment results demonstrate that using K-NN is effective in classifica-
tion performance compared to other models such as Naive Bayes,Maximum Entropy Model,Support Vector Machine
(SVM),Decision Tree Learning and Hybrid.With enough training data, researchers could perform an experiment and
check the learning curve with accuracy that compares to state of art NER|Kamau et al]

5.6 Question Answering

The application of question-answering methodologies to indigenous Kenyan languages significantly lags behind rich-
resource languages such as English. Recently, advancement have relied on large-scale language modeling, for which
one example is available in Kiswahili, UlizaLlama, by JacarandaHealth, which uses a version of the ALPACA dataset
translated into Kiswahili. version of the ALPACA dataset. Another initiative aimed at advancing question-answering
for African languages is AfriQA

The need for Question Answering datasets in low resource languages also motivated the development of
KenSwQuAD.The dataset was annotated from raw story texts of Swahili low resource language, which is a predom-
inantly spoken in Eastern African and in other parts of the world. Question Answering (QA) datasets are important
for machine comprehension of natural language for tasks such as internet search and dialogue systems. The research
involved annotators in creating QA pairs from Swahili texts gathered by the Kencorpus project, which is a corpus of
Kenyan languages. Out of a total of 2,585 texts, 1,445 were annotated, each with at least five QA pairs, resulting in a fi-
nal dataset of 7,526 QA pairs. A quality assurance check on 12.5 percent of the annotated texts verified the correctness
of all QA pairs. A proof of concept demonstrated that this dataset is suitable for QA tasks. Additionally, KenSwQuAD
has enhanced the resources available for the Swahili language. The dataset used for generating KenSwQuAD was the
Swahili portion of the data collected by the Kencorpus projectWanjawa et al! (2029), Kencorpus project collected
primary data, both text and voice, in three low-resource languages of Swahili, Dholuo and Luhya.

5.7 Natural Language Inference (NLD or Textual Entailment:
Natural Language Inference (NLI), or textual entailment, is a fundamental NLP task determining whether a given

hypothesis logically follows a provided premise. This task typically classifies the relationship between the premise and
hypothesis into one of three categories: entailment, contradiction, or neutral. While NLI models are well-developed

16


State of NLP in Kenya: A Survey A PREPRINT

for high-resource languages like English, their application to low-resource languages, such as those spoken in Kenya,
remains underexplored. Most NLI models that support Kenyan languages, particularly Swahili, are multilingual. These
models often rely on translations of English NLI datasets into Swahili. One example is the Multilingual NLI dataset},
which supports Swahili and has been used in models such as mDeBERTa-v3-base-xnli-multilingual-nli-2mil7.
This model provides coverage for Swahili, leveraging cross-lingual capabilities to address the lack of Swahili-specific
NLI datasets. Additionally, the afrixXNLI dataset includes a test set for various African languages, though Swahili
is the only Kenyan language represented in this dataset. Other Kenyan languages, such as Kikuyu, Luo, and Luhya,
currently lack dedicated NLI datasets or models, which presents a significant gap in the research landscape.

5.8 Pretrained Language Models (PTMs)

In the AI revolution, language modeling is fundamental to NLP. At its core, language modeling involves prediction
of the next word in a sequence given a probability distribution. These models are used in various applications from
autocomplete to more complex tasks like classification and machine translation. The growth of language models has
been catalysed by the availability of large datasets of textual data and development of deep learning architectures such
as transformers.

Despite these advancements in language modelling, African languages have lagged behind due to various factors.
Namely: data scarcity, technological infrastucture and commercial interest. Below we discuss the coverage of Kenyan
languages in pretrain language models and how they are being utilised.

¢ BERT-models, GPT-models, BLOOM-models, Claude, LLaMA-models.

BERT -models which was developed by Google, has been widely used in language modelling . It currently
supports 100 languages however only one Kenyan language, Swahili, is supported Researctl The GPT
models by OpenAI doesn’t support Kenya languages yet however it understands around 60 indigenous lan-
guages from Kenya with limited proficiency. BLOOM-models developed by The BigScience project supports
46 natural languages and of those Swahili is the only Kenyan language supported with a percentage contri-
bution of 0.02[BigScienca Claude developed by Anthropic is known to include support for widely
spoken African languages such as Swahili, which is a major language in Kenya however there is no men-
tion of other Kenyan languages. LLaMA-models , support several Kenyan languages, focusing primarily on
Swahili. Swahili is one of the most widely spoken languages in Kenya. LLaMA models aim to extend support
to other underutilized Kenyan dialects, although the specifics about these dialects are not detailed.

Africa AI o-specific LMs (AfriBERTa, Afro-XLMR, AfroLM, SERENGETI, mBERT)

AfriBERTa |Ogueji et al] model was trained on 11 languages which includes support for Swahili and
Somali, two major languages spoken in Kenya.

AfroXLMR|Alabi et al] model was trained on 17 languages which includes representation of Swahili
and Somali which is spoken in Kenya.

AfroLM|Dossou et al] model is trained on 23 African languages including the Kenyan languages Luo
and Swahili.

The SERENGETI|Adebara and Abdul-Mageed (2022); [Adebara et al] is a multilingual model cover-
ing 517 African languages including Luo, Bukusu, Embu, Chidigo, Ekegusii, Oromo and Borana-Arsi-Gurji,
Gikuyu, Kalenjin, Kikamba, Kuria, Maasai, Giryama, Pokomo (Kipfokomo), Rendile, Samburu, Somali,
Swahili, Teso, Turkana and Tharaka. Datasets in the model are classified as Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo or
Afro-Asiatic

LMs finetuned on Kenyan specific languages (UlizaLLaMA, SwahBERT). These models have been fine-
tuned with Swahili data.
Application Areas of PTMs

UlizaLLaMA, developed by Jacaranda Health, is finetuned to converse fluently in Swahili. This model
helps to improve healthcare.

The AfroXLMR model has been used by [Muhammad et al] in sentiment analysis for 14 African

classification of text in three classes: positive, negative or neutral.

The study by|Alabi et al] used AfriBERTa in multilingual adaptive finetuning (MAFT) for 17 African
languages including Oromo, Swahili and Somali. In the Kenyan context, this model can be used in cross-
lingual transfer learning.

6 Governance, Policies, and Regulations

Governance, policy, ethics, and responsible NLP are interconnected concepts that relate to the oversight, regulation,
and moral considerations of applying Natural Language Processing technologies. studied the
general concepts of AI governance, policies, and regulations. In their work, they argue that AI and other related
technologies are expeditiously advancing. Hence, there is a need to discuss governance, policy, and regulatory issues
in the field. The paper calls on relevant researchers, policymakers and government officials to take these matters into
consideration.

6.1 Assessing AI governance

Progress on AI governance, NLP included, has been slow not only in Kenya but also in the wider continent. The ALT
Advisory 2022 report [Advisory| on AI governance, provides a useful set of indicators upon which to assess
continental and country-level progress on AI governance: existence of AI legislation, existence of Data protection
integrating rights on automated decision making, existence of a national AI strategy,existence of a draft policy on AI
and presence of a task force / commission to oversee AI adoption and AI integration in the national development plan.

6.2 State of AI governance in Kenya
6.2.1 Legislation and strategy

Kenya, like many countries in Africa, neither has a strategy nor regulation governing the AI sector [Hankins et al]
(2023). That said,the past year saw significant legislative activity.On September 8, 2023 The Ministry of Information,
Communications, and the Digital Economy unveiled the Working Group on Policy and Legislative Reforms for the
Information, Communications and the Digital Economy Sector. The mandate of the sector working group includes
reviewing current policy,legal and institutional structures, identifying emerging technologies requiring oversight and
making legislative and policy recommendations. As AI is encapsulated under emerging technologies, recommenda-
tions from this task force are of keen interest to stakeholders. Regarding AI regulation, the Robotics Society Of Kenya
(RSK) introduced a draft bill seeking to regulate the Robotics and AI sector. The draft titled the "Kenya Robotics and
Artificial Intelligence Society Bill, 2023" seeks to provide for the establishment of the Kenya Robotics and Artificial
Intelligence Society whose envisioned mandate includes regulation, licensing,policy guidance,awareness creation and
capacity building (2023).Overall, the draft bill, currently in the petition stage, has attracted vehement oppo-
sition from practitioners on the basis of being punitive, bureaucratic and ill-timed.While it remains to be seen whether
the draft bill will proceed beyond the petition, its mark on the governance discourse , albeit controversial, is cemented.

6.2.2 Data protection integrating rights on automated decision making

In 2019, the Data Protection Act No. 24 of 2019 came into effect . Although not explicit on AI governance, it is of great
relevance to stakeholders within the AI ecosystem, given that data is the cornerstone of AI technology development.
Key tenets of the act related to data protection include:

* incorporating operational and technical systems that include data protection principles, enforceability mech-
anisms, risk management, cyber-security measures, access security, physical security, and de-identification
measures in all AI software and applications like chatbots,

implementing security safeguards to ensure that personal data is accessed only by authorised persons. This
includes technical safeguards for encryption, personnel vetting, and procedural safeguards like restricted
access control and continuous database backup,

limiting the amount of personal data collected for a given purpose. Thus, avoiding the processing of personal
data altogether when possible and ensuring the data collected is minimised,

enforcing transparency and lawfulness. That is, use clear and plain language to communicate with data and
related subjects,

6.2.3 Presence of task force, commission to oversee AI adoption

Increasing interest in the opportunities and challenges brought about by AI technologies has elicited significant inter-
est from stakeholders within the AI ecosystem, leading to the formation of task forces with sector-specific mandates.
To illustrate, the Kenya Blockchain and AI Task Force, formed in 2018, was mandated to study emerging technolo-
gies, their use cases for development goals, and opportunities for Iegislation|Ministry of Information and Technolosy
(5033). The task force outlined important use cases for AI technologies within Kenya’s development framework, and
these suggestions are officially integrated into Kenya’s economic development blueprints through the following:

* Data Science Africa (DSA) - This is a non-profit organisation founded in 2019 by Kenyan researchers,
practitioners, and entrepreneurs passionate about using AI to solve real-world problems. It is main mission is
to work with institutions of higher learning and other government authorities to promote AI and data science
for academia and R&D, and support the adoption of data science and AI in businesses and government. The
researchers are also advocating for ethical use of AI. DSA works with the government to influence AI policies.

IDSA| ([n.d.}).

¢ Information & Communications Technology Authority (ICTA) - I was established in 2013. It is advocat-
ing for e-Government services, development and use of ICT, efficient and effective provision of ICT services
and applications, rights of ICT users,and cyber-security. The authority is working to streamline the manage-
ment of AI and ICT functions within the national and county governments{ICTAl (Ind).

¢ Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) - This is government body that is entrusted safeguard
personal data. It was established under the Data Protection Act of parliament in 2019. Its mandates are
available in|ODPG and on this bases advocates for safe and ethical use of private data in AI research
and innovation.

¢ The Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) serves as the regulatory body that oversees the country’s
communications sector. It was founded in 1999 under the Kenya Information and Communications Act of
1998. Its mandate covers the advancement of various segments within the fields of information and commu-
nication, such as broadcasting, cyber security, multimedia, telecommunications, e-commerce and post and
courier services ([n.d.]). In mid-2024, that authority operationalized the regulatory sandbox to test,

monitor, and govern emerging technologies, innovations, and applications for Al-driven services, including
chatboxes and BERTs|Communication Authority of Kenya (ma.
Both ICTA and CA are domiciled in Ministry of Information Communication and Technology.

7 Indigenous Knowledge Systems and NLP

Indigenous or local knowledge systems (IKS) refer to a body of knowledge, skills, innovations, value and belief
systems passed down through generations in a given cultural locality and acquired through the accumulation of expe-
riences, relationships with the surrounding environment, and traditional community rituals, practices and institutions
(2019). The indigenous knowledge systems are not mere collections of facts but are dynamic, living libraries
of understanding, embodying the wisdom of centuries. IKS encompass a spectrum of skills, innovations, and deeply
held beliefs rooted in the rhythm of local ecosystems, nurtured by communal rituals and enduring practices. Natural
Language Processing (NLP) stands as a bridge between this ancient wisdom and the digital age. It is a tool that has
the potential to decode and digitise these verbal and non-verbal languages, transforming them into accessible data for
the global stage.

8 Discussion

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has garnered growing attention over the past decade, highlighting the undeniable
need for continued research to enhance these techniques. This section provides insight and discusses the progress
made in NLP in Kenya so far.

Section [4] presents that the NLP ecosystem in Kenya is rapidly expanding. These can be understood in the context
of the African continent’s wider digitisation and technologisation. Progress in North, South, West, and East Africa
has provided a context and complement to NLP efforts in Kenya. Internally, the development of datasets such as

Kencorpus|Wanjawa et al] , KenSwQuADWanjawa et al! (2023a) and Mozilla Common Voicd™ have helped

create the necessary input infrastructure for applications such as the case in machine translation, information retrieval,

https ://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en

19


State of NLP in Kenya: A Survey A PREPRINT

sentiment analysis and in general language modelling tasks. As a consequence, various application models such as
Serengeti|Adebara et al} (2022), AfribertlOguel (2022), and AftoXLMR [Azime or all (2023) have been developed for
the Kenya NLP application contexts.

This has been accentuated significantly by international work seeking to broaden the scope of open-source or commer-
cial products to the African continent. International efforts in the creation of datasets in SwahiliChimoto and Bassett
(2022), OromadPan et al| (2017), Somal and other languages have triggered the digital en-

richment of various Kenyan languages. Several languages in Kenya, including most recently Dholuo, have been
incorporated into Google TranslatelGoyalet all

However, this relatively rapid expansion of the NLP ecosystem in Kenya is not without qualification. From an inspec-
tion of the covered datasets, it can be seen that the language with the most resources is Swahili, followed by Oromo,
Somali, and Luo. Most of these languages are transboundary, hence their attractiveness for digitisation. This is also
reproduced in the wider continent, where Bambara (spoken in Mali, Ivory Coast and other West African Countries)
(2021), Arabic in the Nod Foil G02, and Nguni languages (IsiZulu) in the South are widely
captured in NLP dataset{Marivate (2020). There is a danger of "tail of tail" differentiation where the least resourced

African languages in need of the most urgent digital preservation remain unpreserved, leading to a potential loss of
culture in the continent.’

Concomitant to this, there is a possibility that these under-resourced languages will be considered as an international
"terra nullius" - open for the preservation (and possible exploitation) by any global institutions or companies with the
resources to carry out the digitisation and profit from it financially and socially.

One should look to the entrenchment of the gains made in the last decade, taken together with correcting the gaps
identified, whether infrastructural, environmental or incidental. Recognising that the current wave of AI activity has
been formed on the basis of an NLP attractor, it is essential to find ways of institutionalising the NLP ecosystem in
Kenya to ensure the independence and robustness of Kenya’s technological development.

This calls for carefully considering governance and regulation of the country’s AI and data ecosystem. In this devel-
opmental phase of technology, there is a need to develop flexible regulations whose aim is not to bureaucratise, stifle
or gatekeep the industry but to guide it into the possibility of full flourishing. This has been discussed in the previous
section, where the data protection act and the proposed AI and Robotics Bill have been seen as tentative steps taken by
the Government of Kenya in this direction. There is an opportunity here for the Government to involve stakeholders
more organically in ensuring robust legal infrastructure for the growth and takeoff of NLP and AI in the country.

8.1 Research Opportunities: A road map to the Future

8.1.1 IKS and NLP in Climate Action

The effectiveness of climate action depends on the extent to which available knowledge systems have been considered
in the climate change discourse and their inclusivity in addressing the negative impacts of climate change. A fertile
ground for revolutionising climate action strategies lies at the crossroads of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and
Natural Language Processing (NLP). In Kenya, Indigenous communities, stewards of their lands, offer a wealth of eco-
logical wisdom shaped by centuries of sustainable living and intimate interactions with nature. Their practices, from
agroforestry to water conservation, are a testament to a profound understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem manage-
ment—key to combating climate change. However, a significant hurdle remains the need for datasets capturing these
rich IKS worldviews, which hinders the potential of NLP applications. This data gap limits NLP technologies’ ability
to fully comprehend and utilise Indigenous languages and knowledge, excluding these vital perspectives from global
climate action dialogues. In regions where indigenous knowledge has been integrated into technology, for instance,
in the ‘Amazon|Steiskal (2022), NLP has been used to document and translate local knowledge on medicinal plants,
directly influencing sustainable practices and conservation efforts. Similarly, in Australia, Aboriginal fire manage-
ment techniques, once overlooked, are now being studied and modelled through NLP IVarma et all (2024). providing
insights into natural disaster management that are both ancient and innovative. By bridging these gaps, particularly
in Kenya, through dedicated research into creating comprehensive datasets of IKS, NLP can unlock a treasure trove
of environmental strategies. Fusing traditional wisdom and modern technology can enrich our approaches to climate
challenges and ensure a more inclusive and effective global response.

9 Conclusions

This paper underscores the importance of a concerted, long-term strategy for NLP in Kenya. This strategy includes
expanding data resources, developing context-aware models, and engaging with Kenya’s many languages’ cultural

20


State of NLP in Kenya: A Survey A PREPRINT

and linguistic dimensions. Our findings reveal significant gaps in data resources, language models, and the adapta-
tion of existing NLP technologies to the unique linguistic contexts of Kenyan languages. Finally, we offer targeted
recommendations for addressing these gaps, aiming to foster the development of more inclusive, accessible, and con-
textually relevant NLP solutions in Kenya. To address these issues, we propose the following recommendations: a) a
concerted effort should be made to expand the digital footprint of Kenyan languages through collaborative data col-
lection and the creation of language-specific datasets. b) investments in local research and infrastructure are essential
to empower Kenyan NLP Researchers and ensure that innovations are locally driven and sustainable. c) Integrating
Indigenous knowledge systems into NLP workflows can provide critical linguistic and cultural context, enhancing
model performance and ensuring the development of more accurate, context-aware, and culturally sensitive language
technologies.

10 Limitation

Our work is derived from a literature survey on NLP research and publications about Kenyan languages. While we
have covered many key publications, this review is not exhaustive. Due to the scope of our review, other relevant
works and advancements in the field may not have been included. Further studies should aim to capture a more
comprehensive view of the evolving landscape of NLP in Kenya.
