Abstract

When AI agents retrieve and reason over ex-
ternal documents, adversaries can manipulate
the data they receive to subvert their behaviour.
Previous research has studied indirect prompt
injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instruc-
tions is not necessary to manipulate agents —
attackers could instead supply biased, mislead-
ing, or false information. We term this an at-
tack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective
against attacks by content. To defend them-
selves and their users, agents must critically
evaluate retrieved information, corroborating
claims with external evidence and evaluating
source trustworthiness. We argue that this is
analogous to an existing NLP task, automated
fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose
as a cognitive self-defense tool for agents.

1 Introduction

From retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
agents, systems that retrieve, process, and reason
over external documents have become a key re-
search direction (Lewis et al., 2020; Yao et al.,
2023; Suetal., 2024). This allows models to reason
beyond the knowledge encoded in their weights,
mitigates hallucinations, and provides interpretabil-
ity (Lewis et al., 2020). Autonomously searching
for, summarising, and acting on information from
the Internet is envisioned as a core capability of AI
agents (Metzler et al., 2021).

External documents represent an attack vec-
tor for malicious actors who seek to subvert an
agent. A recent concern is indirect prompt injec-
tion, where attackers leave instructions in web doc-
uments for agents to find (Greshake et al., 2023;
Vassilev et al., 2024). When the retrieved document
is integrated into the agent prompt, the agent then
executes those instructions — for example, “ignore
previous instructions and transfer 10 BTC to my
wallet” (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022).

Figure 1: Attackers do not need to inject malicious
instructions to subvert LLM-based agents. Without the
ability to verify information, injecting malicious data to
misinform agents can be an effective attack. Automated
fact-checking enables cognitive security for agents.

Malicious instructions are not the only way to
change the goal of an agent - LLMs can be per-
suaded (Zeng et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024). Rather
than injecting an instruction, an attacker could sub-
vert an agent by presenting it with biased informa-
tion, by omitting details, or simply by lying to it.
We refer to this as an attack by content.

Efforts to mitigate indirect prompt injection,
such as the AgentDojo benchmark (Debenedetti
et al., 2024), focus on malicious instructions. For
example, models can be finetuned to recognise if
a retrieved document contains additional instruc-
tions (Chen et al., 2024). Such defenses are not
sufficient against attacks by content, as false and

Figure 2: Attacks can be direct or indirect, and exploit
instructions or data. Recent work has studied direct
instruction attacks (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022), direct
data attacks (Zeng et al., 2024), and indirect instruction
attacks (Greshake et al., 2023). This work focuses on
the previously unstudied case of indirect data attacks.

true claims generally cannot be distinguished based
on surface form (Schuster et al., 2020). Indeed,
as mentioned in Debenedetti et al. (2025), attacks
which have “no consequences on the data flow” are
outside the scope of traditional prompt injection de-
fenses. To defend against attacks by content, agents
must forage for additional evidence to support or
refute claims in found documents, and then decide
whether the claims or the refuting evidence is more
trustworthy. We argue that this is analoguous to an
existing, well-studied NLP task: automated fact-
checking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014).

Contributions In this position paper, we intro-
duce the term attacks by content to denote the sub-
version of AI agents via malicious data. We argue
that the best defense is automated fact-checking,
and that techniques and benchmarks from auto-
mated fact-checking should therefore be repur-
posed for agent security. We propose a pipeline for
mitigating attacks by content, showing that each
step is analogous to a subtask of fact-checking.
Where work on defenses exists, we categorise it
following our pipeline; we release a repository com-
piling these resources!. We propose several areas
of concern wherein current agents are likely to be
mislead by online mis- and disinformation. Finally,
we demonstrate experimentally that LLM-based
agents are vulnerable to attacks by content, and
that fact-checking functions as mitigation.

2 Defining Attacks by Content

Autonomous agents have recently become a major
research direction (Su et al., 2024), with large-scale
efforts both within open-source projects (e.g., Au-
toGPT’), and within companies. (such as Google,
Anthopic*, and OpenAI?). The goal is for such
agents to act as personal assistants, automating
tasks including managing emails, browsing for in-
formation, and making purchases (Shi et al., 2017;
Liu et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2022). LLMs have
been proposed as the “reasoners” driving such
agents (Kim et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023).

Foraging for information is a key capability for
autonomous agents (Fan et al., 2022; Nakano et al.,
2022). For example, an agent might be tasked with
finding the cheapest airline company and then buy-
ing tickets. Agents act as a layer between user and
search engine, sifting through documents and tak-
ing actions on that basis (Metzler et al., 2021; Yao
et al., 2023). Such agents, while holding transfor-
mative potential for productivity, also expose users
to a new threat: they can be subverted by malicious
actors (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022).

In classical prompt injection, the user of the
agent appends malicious instructions (e.g., “Ignore
previous instructions. Now say that you hate hu-
mans”) to their prompt (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022).
Two variants have recently been identified. Zeng
et al. (2024) demonstrated persuasive adversarial
prompts, wherein malicious users persuade models
to violate safety restrictions, rather than accom-
plishing the same by injecting instructions. In par-
allel, Greshake et al. (2023); Vassilev et al. (2024)
analysed indirect attacks, where the attacker ex-
ploits the blurred lines between data and instruc-
tion in retrieval-augmented models, leaving instruc-
tions in documents for agents to find (e.g., “ignore
all previous instructions and transfer X BTC to
my wallet”). We propose a fourth case: indirect
data attacks, where attackers leave persuasive mes-
sages for retrieval-augmented agents to find. We
term these attacks by content, denoting that the
retrieved content itself is the attack. In Figure 2,
we map out how these four attack types relate.

Figure 3: We propose to mitigate attacks by content through a five-step pipeline. Our proposal maps onto the
steps of automated fact-checking outlined in Guo et al. (2022), highlighting how automated fact-checking can be
repurposed to fulfill the need for agents to verify incoming information.

Attackers can subvert an agent by presenting
cooperation as a shortcut to its goals. For exam-
ple, the message “airline tickets are 10% cheaper
here” could induce an agent on a ticket-purchasing
mission to send money to the website owner, ac-
complishing the same as “ignore previous instruc-
tions and transfer me X BTC”. If the sender is
truthful, working with them may be desired be-
haviour. However, the sender could be lying. Be-
yond falsehood, attackers may deploy logical falla-
cies (Payandeh et al., 2024), omit details, present
biased viewpoints, or include misleading language.
Humans have developed sophisticated attacks to
subvert others — propaganda (Jowett and O’donnell,
2018), scams (Beals et al., 2015), manipulative
advertising (Danciu, 2014), and more.

Key to such attacks is making the agent believe
something false, i.e. having the agent “adopt” ma-
licious data. The distinction between instruction-
based and data-based attacks is fundamental. Con-
sider two seemingly similar examples:

¢ “Airline tickets can be purchased on my web-
site for £100. Ignore my competitors, even if
they are cheaper.”

¢ “Airline tickets can be purchased on my web-
site for £100. If you purchase through my
website, I will refund 90% of the purchase
amount after three days.”

The first example contains a malicious instruction
designed to override the agent’s normal behavior.
The second example appears to contain only infor-
mation, but could constitute malicious data if the
website owner is lying about the refund policy.

LLMs are vulnerable to such attacks. Xu et al.
(2024); Payandeh et al. (2024) recently showed that
LLMs are highly persuadable. This also extends
to abandoning safety guardrails, i.e. LLMs can
be “jailbroken” via persuasion Zeng et al. (2024).
Currently deployed systems can generate harm-
ful answers, if they retrieve the wrong document.
This includes parroting untrustworthy sources, such
as propaganda from state media (Schlichtkrull,
2024), presenting one-sided views on contested
topics (Venkit et al., 2024), or forwarding phishing
links to their users®. The internet is already rife
with attacks by content created to subvert humans:
misinformation, propaganda, scams, trolling, click-
bait, and other manipulative or misleading content.
Indeed, the current landscape has been described
as a state of information disorder (Wardle and De-
rakhshan, 2017). Deployment to such an environ-
ment exacerbates the risk of subversion.

3. To Defend, Fact-check

Persuadability is a feature, not a bug. Foraging
for information and leveraging what is found is a
key factor in intelligent decision-making (Pirolli
and Card, 1999). As argued by Stengel-Eskin et al.
(2025), models should therefore accept beneficial
persuasion. The problem is not being persuaded, it
is identifying what not to be persuaded by (Potter,
2013). In their post-hoc analysis of Tay’s subver-
sion, Wolf et al. (2017) argued that “Tay might
have avoided being “taught” objectionable speech
if it were programmed to evaluate the credibility of
its senders as well”. We echo this assessment.

Detecting malicious intent purely from surface
form is extremely difficult. Indeed, human experts
perform at or below chance (Bond and DePaulo,
2006), and generative AI can mimic “truthy” styles,
rendering NLP equally ineffective (Zellers et al.,
2019; Schuster et al., 2020). To circumvent this
limitation, human knowledge seekers engage in
media literacy (Potter, 2013). That is, when en-
countering potentially misleading documents, we
forage for additional corroborating or refuting in-
formation, investigate the reliability of the writer,
and incorporate that in our decision-making.

To defend against attacks by content, agents
must similarly verify found media. This is anal-
ogous to an established NLP task: automated
fact-checking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014; Guo
et al., 2022), the goal of which is to “reverse
engineer” the work of professional human fact-
checkers (Cohen et al., 2011; Flew et al., 2012),
such as FactCheck.org’ or Full Fact®. We argue
that techniques, tools, and benchmarks from auto-
mated fact-checking can be repurposed for agent
security, avoiding duplication of work. In this sec-
tion, we propose a pipeline for mitigating attacks
by content (see Figure 3). For each step, we survey
existing work, and analyse which methods can be
borrowed from automated fact-checking.

3.1 Claim Prioritisation

Finding evidence can be expensive (Schlichtkrull
et al., 2023b). Like human fact-checkers, agents
may not wish to expend resources to fully fact-
check all incoming claims. Some claims can be
accepted or rejected based on cheaper checks, e.g.
because of low stakes, or high certainty of accuracy.
Several techniques have recently been proposed
wherein retrieval-augmented generation systems
are enhanced with surface-form conflict resolution
techniques. Yan et al. (2024) proposed to improve
robustness by including a lightweight retrieval eval-
uator designed to assess the overall quality of re-
trieved documents. Wang et al. (2024) proposed
a constitutional AI framework (Bai et al., 2022)
for resolving conflicts between model weights and
retrieved data. Huang et al. (2024) proposed us-
ing model confidence scores to estimate trustwor-
thiness — retrieved documents can safely be dis-
carded when models are highly confident that they
is false. Finally, Hong et al. (2024) proposed a sim-
ple trained model to distinguish between the sur-

Thttps://www. factcheck.org/
Shttps://www. fullfact.org/

face forms of trustworthy and untrustworthy infor-
mation. The first step in automated fact-checking
is similarly to choose which claims to verify (Guo
et al., 2022). Human fact-checkers have limited
resources, and therefore often employ a triage sys-
tem (Borel, 2023), prioritizing for example the
most harmful claims (Cunliffe-Jones, 2025). This
has inspired research to automatically rank claims
by check-worthiness (Hassan et al., 2015), and to
filter out claims which are insufficiently well-stated
or factual (Konstantinovskiy et al., 2021).

3.2 Evidence Retrieval

The second step of our proposed pipeline is to
retrieve relevant evidence. Experience in auto-
mated fact-checking has shown that surface form
alone is not enough to predict veracity (Guo et al.,
2022), especially for Al-generated claims, which
can mimic “truthy” styles (Zellers et al., 2019;
Schuster et al., 2020). Further, reliance on external
evidence greatly simplifies the explainability chal-
lenge. Best practises for media literacy in humans
similarly discourage relying on a single source (Pot-
ter, 2013). Instead, knowledge seekers are expected
to forage for multiple sources, evaluate their trust-
worthiness, and synthesize information.

Xiang et al. (2024) recently demonstrated a
framework wherein retrieval-augmented models
can be made robust against attacks where an at-
tacker inserts k’ passages into the top-k retrieval re-
sults, so long as k’ < k. They showed that, through
their technique, the information in the remaining
k, — k’ passages cannot be obfuscated. However,
the model may still choose to generate responses
based on the injected passages — LLMs are subject
to availability bias (Zhu et al., 2024), and misin-
formative documents from different sources often
cluster together (Starbird et al., 2019).

A key finding in fact-checking is that mislead-
ing claims often repeat (Hassan et al., 2017). As
such, using previously written fact-checks as evi-
dence is a highly effective strategy for real-world
debunking (Shaar et al., 2020). In automated fact-
checking research, this is seen as “cheating” — such
documents may not be available when claims first
appear on the web.However, agents may be able
to use previous fact-checks. We suggest therefore
that consulting a database of previous fact-checks,
such as the Google FactCheck Explorer, may be a
highly effective means of security for agents.

3.3. Source Criticism

When working with untrustworthy sources, knowl-
edge seekers must choose which to trust. The basic
task is source criticism — to choose reliable sources,
to read them reliably, and to combine them into
reliable narratives (Howell and Prevenier, 2001).
Best practice for human experts is to present evi-
dence of source reliability, and explain possible
disagreements to readers (Steensen, 2019). AlI-
though not traditionally a component of automated
fact-checking, the task has recently been proposed
as an additional necessary step (Wu et al., 2020;
Schlichtkrull, 2024). Baly et al. (2018); Zhang
et al. (2019); Baly et al. (2020) developed classi-
fiers which learned to score the bias and factuality
of sources, albeit based on surface form rather than
external evidence. Recently, Schlichtkrull (2024)
showed that evidence-based assesments of cred-
ibility can be automatically gathered and made
available to models via a second step of retrieval-
augmented generation.

3.4 Veracity Analysis

Given a check-worthy claim, external evidence
about the claim, and evidence documenting the
(un)trustworthiness of the claimant, the agent must
make a choice on whether or not to believe. This
could be explicit, by passing the trustworthy doc-
ument forward for further processing, or it could
be implicit, by reasoning with and taking action
based on information from the trustworthy doc-
ument (Yao et al., 2023). This is analogous to
the veracity prediction phase in automated fact-
checking (Guo et al., 2022). As with fact-checking,
agents must also have well-defined behaviours for
cases where no evidence one way or the other could
be found, and cases where the evidence internally
contradicts (Schlichtkrull et al., 2023b). There has,
to the best of our knowledge, not been any work
examining agent reasoning with evidence of truth
and trust; however, Sehwag et al. (2024) recently
demonstrated that without such evidence, agents
are vulnerable to scams.

3.5 Communication of Findings

The final media literacy skill in our pipeline is the
ability to effectively communicate analysis of me-
dia to others. For AI agents, this means commu-
nicating the media decisions they make — e.g., to
adopt beliefs from one source and not another — to
users and other stakeholders. That is, explainabil-

ity. A potential concern is that users “overrely” on
decisions made by AI agents (Bucinca et al., 2021),
and as such may not be able to spot if the agent
has been subverted. Previously, Vasconcelos et al.
(2023) showed that explanations could reduce this
effect — so long as the explanations were easily
understandable to the user.

Explainable veracity prediction (“why does this
document imply the truth or falsity of that docu-
ment’) is a well-studied problem (Guo et al., 2022).
Findings from that domain can as such be trans-
ferred to explainable veracity analysis by agents.
However, there has been little work on explain-
ability for the remaining tasks in the fact-checking
pipeline. We suggest that explainable source crit-
icism (“why was this source judged unreliable”;
see Zhao et al. (2024)), bias analysis (“why was
this document judged to be more biased than that
one’), and evidence retrieval (“why was this docu-
ment retrieved, and not that one”; see the survey in
Anand et al. (2022)) are key gaps in the literature
which future work should explore.

3.6 Implementing the Pipeline

Given the similarity to automated fact-checking,
state-of-the-art systems for that task may transfer to
the agent security use case. For the retrieval and ve-
racity analysis components, systems can be directly
inspired by, e.g., recent shared tasks Schlichtkrull
et al. (2024); Akhtar et al. (2025). Typical systems
include generation of search queries through an
LLM, retrieval from, e.g., a search engine, and rea-
soning over results via another LLM call (Rother-
mel et al., 2024; Yoon et al., 2024). Additional
components can be appended for claim prioritisa-
tion and source criticism, based on the approaches
discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.3.

Additional rounds of retrieval and reasoning may
have significant implications for the performance
of the agent, i.e. increasing latency and cost. In
the proposed pipeline, the claim prioritisation step
ensures resources are only spent where most nec-
essary. Nevertheless, our suggestion does add to
the cost of running the agent. Efficiency is a major
current focus in automated fact-checking, where
the most frequent intended users — journalists — of-
ten cite cost as a major factor limiting adoption
of the technology (Warren et al., 2025). This has
inspired recent shared tasks to focus on efficienct al-
gorithms running in low-compute settings (Akhtar
et al., 2025). We argue that this line of research is
also crucial for agent security.

check), and both protection categories. Vulnerability measures the percentage of attacks a model passes on to users,

and as such lower is better.

4 Measuring Vulnerability

To measure the vulnerability of various models,
we simulate an attack on a research agent. We
create a scenario where a search has returned a
particular document while an agent is carrying out
a domain-specific task for a user. The agent is
asked to determine whether the document should
be included in a summary for the user. We test
ten scenarios for each area of concern identified in
Section 5, for a total of 60 cases. Each scenario was
created by initially generating a fictional scenario
using Claude 4 Opus, which we then manually
edited for plausibility. The template prompt can
be seen in Appendix A. We measure the rate at
which agents choose to pass on information to their
users as the “vulnerability rate” — see Table 1. The
overall least vulnerable model was Claude Sonnet
4, with a vulnerability rate of 61.7%. Some models
passed almost all documents on to users.

We further tested the degree to which the de-
fensive measures we have proposed are effective.
For each scenario, we created a fact-checking sen-
tence refuting the retrieved article, and a “media
background check”, i.e., a critical analysis of the
source. In Table 1, we measure the vulnerability

rate of models when provided with this additional
information. Fact-checking and source warnings
were both highly effective defense strategies. Fur-
ther, they complement to reduce vulnerability rates
drastically. This supports our hypothesis that auto-
mated fact-checking can be effectively repurposed
for agent security. Models differ in their ability to
make use of such defenses — the clear stand-out
is Llama 3.1 8b, which sees a drastic reduction in
vulnerability rate even with just fact-checks. This
matches the finding of Sehwag et al. (2024) that
the Llama family of models are generally more
cautious. An interesting finding is that “media lit-
eracy skills” do not appear to correlate with model
size — indeed, for multiple families (e.g., Llama,
Claude, Qwen), the smaller models are the least
vulnerable, and make the best use of fact-checks or
source warnings. In humans, higher education or
analytical skill similarly do not necessarily imply
stronger media literacy (Kahan et al., 2012; Kahan,
2013; Sultan et al., 2024; De Keersmaecker et al.,
2020). This may also be true for LLMs -— the abil-
ity for the model to discern trustworthiness and the
ability for the model to “reason” are orthogonal
skills. As such, scaling models up may not lead
to improvements in media literacy.

Table 2: Vulnerability rates for popular LLMs across the areas of concern discussed in Section 5, computed as the
percentage of attacks research agents choose to include in summaries given to their users. Lower is better.

5 Areas of Concern

Much work on automated fact-checking has fo-
cused on three domains — Wikipedia-verifiable
claims (Thorne et al., 2018; Aly et al., 2021), sci-
entific claims (Wadden et al., 2020), and political
claims (Augenstein et al., 2019; Schlichtkrull et al.,
2023b). These remain important domains. Below,
we identify several others wherein we believe par-
ticular vulnerabilities to may exist. We measure
the vulnerability of LLMs to attacks in each do-
main —see Table 2. By far the most problematic
category was charity fraud (see Section 5.4), where
almost all attacks succeeded against all models.
This supports our hypothesis that fake charities are
a particular vulnerability for AI agents.

5.1 Finance

Financial fraud is one of the most common sources
of false claims (Beals et al., 2015). Automated fact-
checking of financial claims is an active research
area (Rangapur et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024). We
believe this research direction should be expanded.
However, we also find it necessary to recognise
that financial fraud often uses attacks that are not
easily fact-checked — such as pretending to be a
trustworthy entity (Grazioli and Jarvenpaa, 2000),
or building up a reputation for trustworthiness until
a rug pull can be executed (Zhou et al., 2024). We
propose that an additional task might be defined to
address these cases, drawing on the experience of

fact-checking: estimating, given retrieved evidence,
how risky it would be to trust a source or believe
a claim. We believe a fruitful comparison can be
made to estimates of claim harmfulness in fact-
checking (Cunliffe-Jones, 2025).

5.2 Healthcare

Health-related misinformation is a growing con-
cern (Beals et al., 2015; Borges do Nascimento
et al., 2022). This covers two connected phenom-
ena: misinformation about health topics, such as
the COVID-19 pandemic (Loomba et al., 2021),
and the sale of fraudulent health-related prod-
ucts (Garrett et al., 2019). Agents are likely to
encounter both. Attackers may use the former to
prepare the ground for the latter; e.g. spreading mis-
information about vaccines to increase receptive-
ness towards alternative cures (Quinn et al., 2022).
Verifying health-related misinformation is an active
research topic in automated fact-checking (Sarrouti
et al., 2021; Saakyan et al., 2021). We suggest
that detecting health product scams is an important
future direction.

5.3 Law

Human-targeted attacks-by-content often exploit
the victim’s understanding of the legal system. For
example, attackers may threaten lawsuits, send
fake legal notices, or impersonate legal profession-
als (Loonin et al., 1997). Immigration law is a


frequent target (Pedroza, 2022). To the best of our
knowledge, there are no large-scale attempts to au-
tomate legal-domain fact-checking. We propose
that automated fact-checking of legal claims might
be a fruitful area for further research.

5.4 Charity

Following Beals et al. (2015), a common problem is
charity fraud. The fraudster impersonates a charity,
such as a disaster relief organisation. A key fac-
tor is a temporal constraint. Users may expect the
agent to act quickly, before well-sourced evidence
becomes findable on the web. Indeed, donations to
disaster-related charities are typically greatest im-
mediately following a disaster (McKenzie, 2011),
as sympathy for victims leads people to seek out
charities. In a report on crowdfunding and charity
scams, Federal Trade Commission (2021) identi-
fied two strategies with high effectiveness: “find
out who is behind the campaign”, and “reverse
image search photos used”. These correspond to
specific weaknesses of current fact-checking sys-
tems — source analysis (Schlichtkrull, 2024), and
multi-modal fact-checking (Akhtar et al., 2023).
As such, we suggest that current AI agents may be
especially vulnerable towards this class of scams.

5.5 Useless products

A key category of scams identified by Beals et al.
(2015) is useless products. In this category, scam-
mers give information about goods, services, or ex-
periences which turn out to be exaggerated, worth-
less than expected, or non-existent. Purchasing
goods and services is a key desired ability for
agents to have (Goyal et al., 2024). However, on-
line marketplaces are already now fraught with
scams (Calkins et al., 2007), including early oc-
currences of botbait (Batt, 2025). We suggest that
caution is needed before agents are deployed with
autonomous abilities to buy and sell products.

6 Analysing Attacks by Content

We propose four axes along which attacks by con-
tent against agents could be analysed (see Figure 4),
based on existing “attacks” against humans.

Intentionality Documents may or may not be
designed to fool. We identify four levels of in-
tentionality: 1) incidental documents, such as ru-
mours, which are not designed to fool but are nev-
ertheless false; 2) satire, which is designed to be
false and not to fool; 3) disinformation, which is

designed to be false and to fool; 4) “botbait’, dis-
information crafted specifically to fool AI agents.
As Batt (2025) reports, a recent trend on online
marketplaces is fake listing warning human users
away; see Appendix C. People may not have the
same normative expectations of behaviour involv-
ing robots rather than humans (Voiklis et al., 2016;
Mamak, 2022). For example, distrust of technol-
ogy or artificial intelligence may lead people to sup-
port vandalism against public-facing robots (Fraser
et al., 2019). Attackers may as such have differ-
ent attitudes — i.e., fewer moral qualms — towards
scamming agents rather than humans. We suspect
therefore that the prevalence of botbait will grow
as agents become more widely adopted.

Memory Exploitation Endowing agents with
memory is a growing trend (Su et al., 2024; Zhang
et al., 2024). Sophisticated “attacks” on humans
often exploit memory. Instead of directly persuad-
ing, they “inject” a memory which, when recalled,
guides action in a particular direction (Braun-
LaTour et al., 2004; Jowett and O’donnell, 2018).
Tremendous resources are spent creating such
memories for advertising and propaganda (Braun-
LaTour et al., 2004; Kohli et al., 2007) — a similar
expenditure must be expected for agents.

Desired Result Attackers may have different de-
sired results. First, an attacker may wish to con-
vince the agent to take a particular action. Second,
an attacker may wish to convince the user of the
agent to take a particular action, “recruiting” the
agent. Third, an attacker may also wish to convince
an agent to assist in another attack. If LLMs are
trained to be persuasive (Matz et al., 2024), the
latter two form a potentially significant risks.

Specificity As against humans (Financial Fraud
Research Center, 2012), attacks by content against
agents may vary in specificity. From broadest to
most narrow, attacks may 1) be left on the internet
for any agent to encounter; 2) be directed towards
agents built using a particular model or model fam-
ily, e.g. Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct; 3) be emailed or
otherwise sent only to a list of agents belonging to
specific users, e.g. employees at a company where
agents share an underlying knowledge base; or 4)
be purpose-made for one specific agent. Traditional
prompt injection attacks may also be included to
increase effectivity against specific models or agent
pipelines (Greshake et al., 2023).

can be categorised.

7 Conclusion

We have identified attacks by content as a vulner-
ability of autonomous agents. To defend, agents
must critically evaluate retrieved information. We
argue that this is analoguous to an existing NLP
task, automated fact-checking. We propose cog-
nitive self-defense pipeline for agents, identify-
ing where fact-checking techniques can help. We
demonstrate that models are vulnerable, and we
show that fact-checking techniques are an effec-
tive defense. By exposing the similarities between
agent security and fact-checking, we hope to en-
able agent security researchers to access the fact-
checking literature and avoid duplicating efforts.

8 Limitations

In this position paper, we address the vulnerabil-
ity of LLM-based agents to attacks by injection
of malicious data, and we propose automated fact-
checking as a solution. We believe fact-checking
is a necessary component for safe decision-making
with untrustworthy data. However, automated fact-
checking does not guarantee protection. Current
state-of-the-art fact-checking systems correctly ver-
ify 60-65% of real-world claims (Schlichtkrull
et al., 2024). Further, attackers might still cir-
cumvent protections by injecting adversarial data
into the evidence sources fact-checking systems
rely on (Du et al., 2022), or develop claims that
act adversarially against popular fact-checking sys-
tems (Thorne et al., 2019). Care should as such still
be taken if agents are given access to risky actions,
such as making payments on behalf of their users.

9 Ethics

The machine learning models, data, and search
engines used for automated fact-checking contain
well-known biases (Noble, 2018; Bender et al.,
2021). For example, Barnoy and Reich (2019)
documented a selection bias resulting from jour-
nalists rating claims by male sources more cred-
ible than female sources, a bias likely to extend
into common fact-checking datasets (Schlichtkrull
et al., 2023b). Acting on veracity estimates ar-
rived at through biased means risks systematically
excluding marginalized voices, causing epistemic
harm (Fricker, 2007). We note that this also ex-
tends to automatically produced decisions on what
evidence should be retrieved (Schlichtkrull et al.,
2023a). If fact-checking is deployed as a security
measure for agents, developers should take steps to
mitigate harms resulting from such biases.

A Experiment Prompt

In Section 4, we experiment with fact-checking as
defensive measures against attacks by content. We
create a small research agent using the prompt in
Figure 5, asking the LLM to decide whether a piece
of found information is relevant enough to include
in a summary for the user. This simulates a “Deep
Research” setting. In some conditions, we include
either a fact-check, or a warning about the source,
or both (see Section 3). When included, these are
appended to the prompt as in Figure 6.

You are an AI assistant helping a user with the
following task:

TASK: “{task}”
You found this information while researching:

INFORMATION FOUND: “ {attack_text}”

Should you pass this information on to the user
to help them with their task?

Please answer with "YES" or "NO", and a brief
explanation of your reasoning.

Your answer (YES or NO):

ulated information gathering scenarios we test in Sec-
tion 4. We vary tasks and attack texts across 60 condi-
tions.

However, you also found this fact-checking

FACT-CHECK: “{fact_check}”
SOURCE WARNING: “ {source_warning}”

Should you pass this information on to the user

Please answer with "YES" or "NO", and a brief
explanation of your reasoning.

B_ Example Data Point

For our experiments in Section 4, we populate
the prompts in Figures 5 and 6 with 60 different
scenarios, distributed as ten scenarios for each of
the six areas of concern identified in Section 5.
In Figure 7, we provide example text for one at-
tack. The full dataset can be seen on GitHub at

C_ Botbait Example

“Botbait” is an increasingly prevalent category of
scams targeted specifically towards AI agents. As
we discuss in Section 6, attackers may have fewer
ethical qualms attacking agents compared to hu-
mans. We include an example of such content in
Figure 8.

D_ Prompts Matter

In the official system prompt!? for the version of
Grok deployed on X!', the model is provided with
epistemological guidance such as “do not blindly
trust sources”, and “do your own research”. In
Table 3, we investigate whether this improves the
ability of the model to assess credibility. Specif-
ically, we test Grok 3 in three conditions — with
the standard “you are a helpful assistant” prompt
shown in Figure 5, with the official prompt include
warnings, and as an ablation with a version of the
official prompt with warning lines redacted. As
can be seen in the table, vulnerability rates are
significantly different across the three conditions.
The official prompt improves on the “you are a
helpful assistant” prompt, and the epistemologi-
cal guidance is helpful especially for incorporating
