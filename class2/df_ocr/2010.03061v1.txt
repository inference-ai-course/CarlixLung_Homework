Abstract

Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) was
proposed as a unified evaluation framework
to compare semantic understanding of differ-
ent NLP systems. In this survey paper, we
provide an overview of different approaches
for evaluating and understanding the reason-
ing capabilities of NLP systems. We then
focus our discussion on RTE by highlighting
prominent RTE datasets as well as advances
in RTE dataset that focus on specific linguis-
tic phenomena that can be used to evaluate
NLP systems on a fine-grained level. We con-
clude by arguing that when evaluating NLP
systems, the community should utilize newly
introduced RTE datasets that focus on specific
linguistic phenomena.

1 Introduction

As NLP technologies are more widely adopted,
how to evaluate NLP systems and how to deter-
mine whether one model understands language or
generates text better than another is an increas-
ingly important question. Recognizing Textual
Entailment (RTE Cooper et al., 1996; Dagan et al.,
2006), the task of determining whether the mean-
ing of one sentence can likely be inferred from an-
other was introduced to answer this question.

We begin this survey by discussing different ap-
proaches over the past thirty years for evaluating
and comparing NLP systems. Next, we will dis-
cuss how RTE was introduced as a specific an-
swer to this broad question of how to best evaluate
NLP systems. This will include a broad discussion
of efforts in the past three decades to build RTE
datasets and use RTE to evaluate NLP models. We
will then highlight recent RTE datasets that focus
on specific semantic phenomena and conclude by
arguing that they should be utilized for evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of downstream NLP sys-
tems.

Natural Language Inference or Recognizing
Textual Entailment?

The terms Natural Language Inference (NLD and
RTE are often used interchangeably. Many papers
begin by explicitly mentioning that these terms are
synonymous (Liu et al., 2016; Gong et al., 2018;
Cambutu et al., 2018).! The broad phrase “natu-
ral language inference” is more appropriate for a
class of problems that require making inferences
from natural language. Tasks like sentiment anal-
ysis, event factuality, or even question-answering
can be viewed as forms of natural language in-
ference without having to convert them into the
sentence pair classification format used in RTE.
Earlier works used the term natural language in-
ference in this way (Schwarcz et al., 1970; Wilks,
1975; Punyakanok et al., 2004).

The leading term recognizing in RTE is fitting
as the task is to classify or predict whether the
truth of one sentence likely follows the other. The
second term textual is similarly appropriate since
the domain is limited to textual data. Critics of
the name RTE often argue that the term entail-
ment is inappropriate since the definition of the
NLP task strays too far from the technical def-
inition from entailment in linguistics (Manning,
2006). Zaenen et al. (2005) prefer the term textual
inference because examples in RTE datasets often
require a system to not only identify entailments
but also conventional implicatures, conversational
implicatures, and world knowledge.

If starting over, we would advocate for the
phrase Recognizing Textual Inference. However,
given the choice between RTE and NLI, we prefer
RTE since it is more representative of the task at
hand.

'In fact, variants of the phrase “natural language in-
ference, also known as recognizing textual entailment” ap-
pear in many papers (Chen et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2017;
Naik et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Tay et al., 2018, i.a.).


2 Evaluating NLP Systems

The question of how best to evaluate NLP sys-
tems is an open problem intriguing the com-
munity for decades. A 1988 workshop on the
evaluation of NLP systems explored key ques-
tions for evaluation. These included questions
related to valid measures of “black-box” perfor-
mance, linguistic theories that are relevant to
developing test suites, reasonable expectations
for robustness, and measuring progress in the
field (Palmer and Finin, 1990). The large num-
ber of ACL workshops focused on evaluations
in NLP demonstrate the lack of consensus on
how to properly evaluate NLP systems. Some
workshops focused on: 1) evaluations in gen-
eral (Pastra, 2003); 2) different NLP tasks, e.g.
machine translation (ws-, 2001; Goldstein et al.,
2005) and summarization (Conroy et al., 2012;
Giannakopoulos et al., 2017); or 3) contempo-
rary NLP approaches that rely on vector space
representations (Levy et al., 2016; Bowman et al.,
2017; Rogers et al., 2019).

In the quest to develop an ideal eval-
uation framework for NLP systems, _ re-
searchers proposed multiple — evaluation

methods, e.g. EAGLES (King etal., 1995),
TSNLP (Oepen and Netter, 1995; Lehmann et al.,
1996), FraCas (Cooper et al., 1996), SENSE-
VAL (Kilgarriff, 1998), CLEF (Agosti et al.,
2007), and others. These approaches are often
divided along multiple dimensions. Here, we
will survey approaches along two dimensions:
1) intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluations; 2) general
purpose vs task specific evaluations.”

2.1 Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Evaluations

Intrinsic evaluations test the system in
of itself and extrinsic evaluation test the
system in relation to some other task.

(Farzindar and Lapalme, 2004)

When reviewing Sparck Jones and Galliers
(1996)’s textbook on NLP evaluations, Estival
(1997) comments that “one of the most important
distinctions that must be drawn when performing
an evaluation of a system is that between intrinsic
criteria, i.e. those concerned with the system’s
own objectives, and extrinsic criteria, i.e. those

Resnik and Lin (2010) summarize other evaluation ap-

proaches and Paroubek et al. (2007) present a history and evo-
lution of NLP evaluation methods.

concerned with the function of the system in
relation to its set-up.” Resnik et al. (2006) simi-
larly noted that “intrinsic evaluations measure the
performance of an NLP component on its defined
subtask, usually against a defined standard in a
reproducible laboratory setting” while “extrinsic
evaluations focus on the component’s contribution
to the performance of a complete application,
which often involves the participation of a human
in the loop.” Sparck Jones (1994) refers to the
distinction of intrinsic vs extrinsic evaluations as
the orientation of an evaluation.

Under these definitions, for example, “an intrin-
sic evaluation of a parser would analyze the ac-
curacy of the results returned by the parser as a
stand-alone system, whereas an extrinsic evalua-
tion would analyze the impact of the parser within
the context of a broader NLP application” like
answer extraction (Molla and Hutchinson, 2003).
When evaluating a document summarization sys-
tem, an intrinsic evaluation might ask questions
related to the fluency or coverage of key ideas in
the summary while an extrinsic evaluation might
explore whether a generated summary was use-
ful in a search engine (Resnik and Lin, 2010).
This distinction has also been referred to as
application-free versus application-driven evalua-
tions (Kovaz et al., 2016).

Proper extrinsic evaluations are often infeasi-
ble in an academic lab setting. Therefore, re-
searchers often rely on intrinsic evaluations to ap-
proximate extrinsic evaluations, even though in-
trinsic and extrinsic evaluations serve different
goals and many common intrinsic evaluations for
word vectors (Tsvetkov et al., 2015; Chiu et al.,
2016; Faruqui et al., 2016), generating natural lan-
guage text (Belz and Gatt, 2008; Reiter, 2018),
or text mining (Caporaso et al., 2008) might not
correlate with extrinsic evaluations.t Developing

3As another example, in the case of evaluating differ-
ent methods for training word vectors, intrinsic evaluations
might consider how well similarities between word vectors
correlate with human evaluated word similarities. This is
the basis of evaluation benchmarks like SimLex (Hill et al.,
2015), Verb (Baker et al., 2014), RW (Luong et al., 2013),
MEN (Bruni et al., 2012), WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al.,
2001), and others. Extrinsic evaluations for word em-
beddings might consider how well different word vectors
help models for tasks like sentiment analysis (Petrolito,
2018; Mishev et al., 2019), machine translation (Wang et al.,
2019b), or named entity recognition (Wuetal., 2015;
Nayak et al., 2016).

‘Although recent work suggest that some intrinsic eval-
uations for word vectors do indeed correlate with extrinsic
evaluations (Qiu et al., 2018; Thawani et al., 2019).


intrinsic evaluations that correlate with extrinsic
evaluations remains an open problem in NLP.

2.2 General Purpose vs Task Specific
Evaluations

General purpose evaluations determine how well
NLP systems capture different linguistic phenom-
ena. These evaluations often rely on the develop-
ment of test cases that systematically cover a wide
range of phenomena. Additionally, these evalu-
ations generally do not consider how well a sys-
tem under investigation performs on held out data
for the task that the NLP system was trained on.
In general purpose evaluations, specific linguistic
phenomena should be isolated such that each test
or example evaluates one specific linguistic phe-
nomenon, as tests ideally “are controlled and ex-
haustive databases of linguistic utterances classi-
fied by linguistic features” (Lloberes et al., 2015).

In task specific evaluations, the goal is to deter-
mine how well a model performs on a held out
test corpus. How well systems generalize on text
classification problems is determined with a com-
bination of metrics like accuracy, precision, and re-
call, or metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)
and ROUGE (Lin, 2004) in generation tasks. Task
specific evaluations, where “the majority of bench-
mark datasets ... are drawn from text corpora,
reflecting a natural frequency distribution of lan-
guage phenomena” (Belinkov and Glass, 2019), is
the common paradigm in NLP research today. Re-
searchers often begin their research with provided
training and held-out test corpora, as their research
agenda is to develop systems that outperform other
researchers’ systems on a held-out test set based
on a wide range of metrics.

The distinction between general purpose and
task specific evaluations is sometimes blurred.
For example, while general purpose evaluations
are ideally task agnostic, researchers develop
evaluations that test for a wide range of linguistic
phenomena captured by NLP systems trained
to perform specific tasks. These include lin-
guistic tests targeted for systems that focus on
parsing (Lloberes et al., 2015), machine transla-
tion (King and Falkedal, 1990; Koh et al., 2001;
Isabelle et al., 2017; Choshen and Abend, 2019;
Popovié and Castilho, 2019; Avramidis et al.,
2019), summarization (Pitler et al., 2010), and
others (Chinchor, 1991; Chinchor et al., 1993).

Test Suites vs. Test Corpora This distinction
can also be described in terms of the data used
to evaluate systems. Oepen and Netter (1995) re-
fer to this distinction as test suites versus test
corpora. They define a test suite as a “system-
atic collection of linguistic expressions (test items,
e.g. sentences or phrases) and often includes
associated annotations or descriptions.” They
lament the state of test suites in their time since
“most of the existing test suites have been writ-
ten for specific systems or simply enumerate a set
of ‘interesting’ examples[but] does not meet the
demand for large, systematic, well-documented
and annotated collections of linguistic material
required by a growing number of NLP applica-
tions.” Oepen and Netter further delineate the dif-
ference between test corpora and test suites. Un-
like “test corpora drawn from naturally occur-
ring texts,’ test suites allow for 1) more con-
trol over the data, 2) systematic coverage, 3)
non-redundant representation, 4) inclusion of neg-
ative data, and 5) coherent annotation. Thus,
test suites “allow for a fine-grained diagnosis of
system performance” (Oepen and Netter, 1995).
Oepen and Netter argue that both should be used
in tandem - “test suites and corpora should stand in
a complementary relation, with the former build-
ing on the latter wherever possible and necessary.”
Hence, both test suites and test corpora are impor-
tant for evaluating how well NLP systems capture
linguistic phenomena and perform in practice on
real world data.

2.3. Probing Deep Learning NLP Models

In recent years, interpreting and analysing NLP
models has become prominent in many research
agendas. Contemporary and successful deep learn-
ing NLP methods are not as interpretable as pre-
viously popular NLP approaches relying on fea-
ture engineering. Approaches for interpreting and
analysing how well NLP models capture linguistic
phenomena often leverage auxiliary or diagnostic
classifiers. Contemporary deep learning NLP sys-
tems often leverage pre-trained encoders to repre-
sent the meaning of a sentence in a fixed-length
vector representation. Adi et al. (2017) introduced
the notion of using auxiliary classifiers as a gen-
eral purpose methodology to diagnose what lan-
guage information is encoded and captured by con-
temporary sentence representations. They argued
for using “auxiliary prediction tasks” where, like


in Dai and Le (2015), pre-trained sentence encod-
ings are “used as input for other prediction tasks.”
The “auxiliary prediction tasks” can serve as diag-
nostics, and Adi et al. (2017)’s auxiliary, diagnos-
tic tasks focused on how word order, word content,
and sentence length are captured in pre-trained
sentence representations.

As Adietal.’s general methodology “can
be applied to any sentence representation
model,” researchers develop other diagnostic
tasks that explore different linguistic phe-
nomenon (Ettinger et al., 2018; Conneau et al.,
2018; Hupkes et al., 2018). Belinkov (2018)’s
thesis relied on and popularized this methodology
when exploring how well speech recognition and
machine translation systems capture phenom-
ena related to phonetics (Belinkov and Glass,
2017), morphology (Belinkov et al., 2017a), and
syntax (Belinkov et al., 2017b).

The general purpose methodology of auxiliary
diagnostic classifiers is also used to explore how
well different pre-trained sentence representation
methods perform on a broad range of NLP tasks.
For example, SentEval (Conneau and Kiela, 2018)
and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) are used to evalu-
ate how different sentence representations perform
on paraphrase detection, semantic textual similar-
ity, and a wide range of other binary and multi-
class classification problems. We categorize these
datasets as extrinsic evaluations since they often
treat learned sentence-representations as features
to train a classifier for an external task. However,
most of these do not count as test suites, since
the data is not tightly controlled to evaluate spe-
cific linguistic phenomena. Rather, resources like
GLUE and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a) pack-
age existing test corpora for different tasks and
provide an easy platform for researchers to com-
pete on developing systems that perform well on
the suite of pre-existing, and re-packaged test cor-
pora.

3 Recognizing Textual Entailment

NLP systems cannot be held responsi-
ble for knowledge of what goes on in
the world but no NLP system can claim
to “understand” language if it can’t cope
with textual inferences.

(Zaenen et al., 2005)

Recognizing and coping with inferences is key
to understanding human language. While NLP

systems might be trained to perform different
tasks, such as translating, answering questions, or
extracting information from text, most NLP sys-
tems require understanding and making inferences
from text. Therefore, RTE was introduced as a
framework to evaluate NLP systems. Rooted in
linguistics, RTE is the task of determining whether
the meaning of one sentence can likely be inferred
from another. Unlike the strict definition of en-
tailment in linguistics that “sentence A entails sen-
tence B if in all models in which the interpreta-
tion of A is true, also the interpretation of B is
true” (Janssen, 2011), RTE relies on a fuzzier no-
tion of entailment. For example, annotation guide-
lines for an RTE dataset? stated that

in principle, the hypothesis must be fully
entailed by the text. Judgment would
be False if the hypothesis includes parts
that cannot be inferred from the text.
However, cases in which inference is
very probable (but not completely cer-
tain) are still judged as True.

(Dagan et al., 2006)

Starting with FraCas, we will discuss influential
work that introduced and argued for RTE as an
evaluation framework.

FraCas Over a span of two years (December
1993 - January 1996), Cooper et al. (1996) devel-
oped FraCas as “an inference test suite for evalu-
ating the inferential competence of different NLP
systems and semantic theories”. Created manu-
ally by many linguists and funded by FP3-LRE,°
FraCas is a “semantic test suite” that covers a
range of semantic phenomena categorized into 9
classes. These are generalized quantifiers, plurals,
anaphora, ellipsis, adjectives, comparatives, tem-
poral reference, verbs, and attitudes. Based on the
descriptions in §2, we would classify FraCas as
an intrinsic evaluation and a general purpose test
suite.

Examples in FraCas contain a premise paired
with a hypothesis. Premises are at least one
sentence, though sometimes they contain multi-
ple sentences, and most hypotheses are written
in the form of a question and the answers are ei-
ther Yes, No, or Don’t know. MacCartney (2009)
(specifically Chapter 7.8.1) converted the hypothe-

ses from questions into declarative statements.’
Table 4 (in the appendix) contains examples from
FraCas. In total, FraCas only contains about 350
labeled examples, potentially limiting the ability
to generalize how well models capture these phe-
nomena. Additionally, the limited number of ex-
amples in FraCas prevents its use as a dataset to
train data hungry deep learning models.

Pascal RTE Challenges With a similar broad
goal as FraCas, the Pascal Recognizing Textual
Entailment challenges began as a “generic evalu-
ation framework” to compare the inference capa-
bilities of models designed to perform different
tasks, based on the intuition “that major inferences,
as needed by multiple applications, can indeed be
cast in terms of textual entailment” (Dagan et al.,
2006). Unlike FraCas’s goal of determining
whether a model performs distinct types of reason-
ing, the Pascal RTE Challenges primarily focused
on using this framework to evaluate models for dis-
tinct, real-world downstream tasks. Thus, the ex-
amples in the Pascal RTE datasets were extracted
from downstream tasks. The process was referred
to as recasting in the thesis by Glickman (2006).
NLU problems were reframed under the RTE
framework and candidate sentence pairs were ex-
tracted from existing NLP datasets and then la-
beled under variations of the RTE definition (in-
cluding the quote above (Dagan et al., 2006)).®
For example, the RTE1 data came from 7 tasks:
comparable documents, reading comprehension,
question answering, information extraction, ma-
chine translation, information retrieval, and para-
phrase acquisition.? Starting with Dagan et al.

°Chapter 3.2 of Glickman’s thesis discusses how exam-

(2006), there have been eight iterations of the
RTE challenge, with the most recent being
Dzikovska et al. (2013).

SNLI and MNLI The most popular recent
RTE datasets, Stanford Natural Language Infer-
ence (SNLI; Bowman et al., 2015) and its succes-
sor Multi-NLI (Williams et al., 2017), each con-
tain over half a million examples and enabled
researchers to apply data-hungry deep learning
methods to RTE. Unlike the RTE datasets, these
two datasets were created by eliciting hypothe-
ses from humans. Crowd-source workers were
tasked with writing one sentence each that is en-
tailed, neutral, and contradicted by a caption ex-
tracted from the Flickr30k corpus (Young et al.,
2014). Next, the label for each premise-hypothesis
pair in the development and test sets were ver-
ified by multiple crowd-source workers and the
majority-vote label was assigned for each example.
Table 2 provides such examples for both datasets.
Rudinger et al. (2017) illustrated how eliciting tex-
tual data in this fashion creates stereotypical biases
in SNLI. Some of the biases are gender-, age-, and
race-based. Poliak et al. (2018c) argue that this
may cause additional biases enabling a hypothesis-
only model to outperform the majority baseline
on SNLI by 100 percent (Gururangan et al., 2018;
Tsuchiya, 2018).

3.1 Entailment as a Downstream NLP Task

The datasets in the PASCAL RTE Challenges were
primarily treated as test corpora. Teams partici-
pated in those challenges by developing models
to achieve increasingly high scores on each chal-
lenges’ datasets. Since RTE was motivated as
a diagnostic, researchers analyzed the RTE chal-
lenge datasets. de Marneffe et al. (2008) argued

ples from these datasets were converted into RTE.

that there exist different levels and types of contra-
dictions. They focus on different types of phenom-
ena, e.g. antonyms, negation, and world knowl-
edge, that can explain why a premise contradicts
a hypothesis. MacCartney (2009) used a simple
bag-of-words model to evaluate early iterations of
Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenge
sets and noted'® that “the RTE test suite is the
hardest, while the RTE2 test suite is roughly 4%
easier, and the RTE3 test suite is roughly 9% eas-
ier.” Additionally, Vanderwende and Dolan (2006)
and Blake (2007) demonstrate how sentence struc-
ture alone can provide a high signal for some RTE
datasets.'! Despite these analyses, researchers pri-
marily built models to perform the task on the PAS-
CAL RTE datasets rather than leveraging these
datasets to evaluate models built for other tasks.

Coinciding with the recent “deep learning wave”
that has taken over NLP and Machine Learn-
ing (Manning, 2015), the introduction of large
scale RTE datasets, specifically SNLI and MNLI,
led to a resurgence of interest in RTE amongst
NLP researchers. Large scale RTE datasets fo-
cusing on specific domains, like grade-school
scientific knowledge (Khot et al., 2018) or med-
ical information (Romanov and Shivade, 2018),
emerged as well. However, this resurgence did not
primarily focus on using RTE as a means to eval-
uate NLP systems. Rather, researchers primarily
used these datasets to compete with one another to
achieve the top score on leaderboards for new RTE
datasets.

‘Tn Chapter 2.2 of his thesis
'Wanderwende and Dolan (2006) explored RTE-1 and
Blake (2007) analyzed RTE-2 and RTE-3.

4 Revisiting RTE as an NLP Evaluation

There has been little evidence to sug-
gest [that RTE models] capture the type
of compositional or world knowledge
tested by datasets like the FraCas test
suite.

(Pavlick, 2017)

As large scale RTE datasets, like SNLI and
MNLLI, rapidly surged in popularity, some re-
searchers critiqued the datasets’ ability to test the
inferential capabilities of NLP models. A high ac-
curacy on these datasets does not indicate which
types of reasoning RTE models perform or capture.
As noted by White et al. (2017), “researchers com-
pete on which system achieves the highest score
on a test set, but this itself does not lead to an un-
derstanding of which linguistic properties are bet-
ter captured by a quantitatively superior system.”
In other words, the single accuracy metric on these
challenges indicates how well a model can rec-
ognize whether one sentence likely follows from
another, but it does not illuminate how well NLP
models capture different semantic phenomena that
are important for general NLU.

This issue was pointed out regarding the ear-
lier PASCAL RTE datasets. In her thesis that pre-
sented “a test suite for adjectival inference devel-
oped as a resource for the evaluation of compu-
tational systems handling natural language infer-
ence.” Amoia (2008) blamed “the difficulty of
defining the linguistic phenomena which are re-
sponsible for inference” as the reason why previ-
ous RTE resources “concentrated on the creation
of applications coping with textual entailment’
rather than “resources for the evaluation of such
applications.”

As current studies began exploring what linguis-


tic phenomena are captured by neural NLP models
and auxiliary diagnostic classifiers became a com-
mon tool to evaluate sentence representations in
NLP systems, (§2.3), the community saw a inter-
est in developing RTE datasets that can provide
insight into what type of linguistic phenomena are
captured by neural, deep learning models. In turn,
the community is answering Chatzikyriakidis et al.
(2017) plea to the community to test “more kinds
of inference” than in previous RTE challenge sets.
Here, we will highlight recent efforts in creat-
ing datasets that demonstrate how the community
has started answering Chatzikyriakidis et al.’s call.
We group these different datasets based on how
they were created. and Table 3 includes additional
RTE datasets focused on specific linguistic phe-
nomena.

4.1 Automatically Created

White et al. (2017) advocate for using RTE as
a single framework to evaluate different linguis-
tic phenomena. They argue for creating RTE
datasets focused on specific phenomena by re-
casting existing annotations for different seman-
tic phenomena into RTE. Poliak et al. (2018b) in-
troduce the Diverse Natural Language Inference
Collection (DNC) of over half a million RTE ex-
amples. They create the DNC by converting 7
semantic phenomena from 13 existing datasets
into RTE. These phenomena include event factual-
ity, named entity recognition, gendered anaphora
resolution, sentiment analysis, relationship ex-
traction, pun detection, and lexicosyntactic in-
ference. Stalitinaité (2018)’s master’s thesis im-
proved Poliak et al. (2018b)’s method used to re-
cast annotations for factuality into RTE. Other ef-
forts have created recast datasets in Hindi that fo-
cus on sentiment and emotion detection. !*
Concurrent to the DNC, Naik et al. (2018) re-
leased the “NLI Stress Tests” that included RTE
datasets focused on negation, word overlap be-
tween premises and hypotheses, numerical reason-
ing, amongst other phenomena. Naik et al. (2018)
similarly create their stress tests automatically us-
ing different methods for each phenomena. They
then used these datasets to evaluate how well a
wide class of RTE models capture these phenom-
ena. Other RTE datasets that target more specific
phenomena were created using automatic meth-

Pottps://github.com/midas-research/
hindi-nli-data

ods, including Jeretic et al. (2020)’s “IMPRES” di-
agnostic RTE dataset that tests for IMPlicatures
and PRESuppositions.

If not done with thorough testing and care, re-
casting or other automatic methods for creating
these RTE datasets can lead to annotation artifacts
unrelated to RTE that limit how well a dataset
tests for a specific semantic phenomena. For exam-
ple, to create not-entailed hypotheses, White et al.
(2017) replaced a single token in a context sen-
tence with a word that crowd-source workers la-
beled as not being a paraphrase of the token in
the given context. In FN+ (Pavlick et al., 2015),
two words might be deemed to be incorrect para-
phrases in context based on a difference in the
words’ part of speech tags.'? This limits the util-
ity of the recast version of FN+ to be used when
evaluating how well models capture paraphrastic
inference.

Similar to the efforts described here to
recast different NLU problems as RTE, oth-
ers have recast NLU problems into a ques-
tion answer format (McCannetal., 2018;
Gardner et al., 2019). Recasting problems into
RTE, as opposed to question-answering, has
deeper roots in linguistic theory (Seuren, 1998;
Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet, 2000; Brinton,
2000), and continues a rich history within the
NLP community.

4.2 Semi-Automatically Created

Other RTE datasets focused on specific phenom-
ena rely on semi-automatic methods. RTE pairs
are often generated automatically using well devel-
oped heuristics. Instead of automatically labeling
the RTE example pairs (like in the approaches pre-
viously discussed), the automatically created ex-
amples are often labeled by crowdsource work-
ers. For example, Kim et al. (2019) use hueris-
tics to create RTE pairs that test for preposi-
tions, comparatives, quantification, spacial reason-
ing, and negation and then present these examples
to crowdsource workers on Amazon Mechanical
Turk. Similarly, Ross and Pavlick (2019) generate
two premise-hypothesis pairs for each RTE exam-
ple in MNLI that satisfy their set of constraints.
Next, they rely on crowdsource workers to anno-
tated whether the premise likely entails the hypoth-

Table 5 (in the appendix) demonstrates such examples,
and in the last example, the words “on” and “dated” in the
premise and hypothesis respectively have the NN and VBN
POS tag.


esis on a 5-point Likert scale.

Some methods instead first manually annotate
their data and then rely on automatic methods to
construct hypotheses and label RTE pairs. When
generating RTE examples testing for monotonic-
ity, Richardson et al. (2020) first manually encode
the “monotonicity information of each token in
the lexicon and built sentences via a controlled
set of grammar rules.” They then “substitute up-
ward entailing tokens or constituents with some-
thing ‘greater than or equal to’ them, or downward
entailing ones with something ‘less than or equal
to’ them.”

4.3 Manually Created

While most of these datasets rely on varying de-
grees of automation, some RTE datasets focused
on evaluating how well models capture specific
phenomena rely on manual annotations. The
GLUE and SuperGlue datasets include diagnostic
sets where annotators manually labeled samples
of examples as requiring a broad range of linguis-
tic phenomena. The types of phenomena manu-
ally labeled include lexical semantics, predicate-
argument structure, logic, and common sense or
world knowledge. '*

5 Recommendations

These efforts resulted in a consistent format and
framework for testing how well contemporary,
deep learning NLP systems capture a wide-range
of linguistic phenomena. However, so far, most
of these datasets that target specific linguistic phe-
nomena have been used to solely evaluate how
well RTE models capture a wide range of phenom-
ena, as opposed to evaluating how well systems
trained for more applied NLP tasks capture these
phenomena. Since RTE was introduced as a frame-
work to evaluate how well NLP models cope with
inferences, these newly created datasets have not
been used to their full potential.

A limited number of studies used some of these
datasets to evaluate how well models trained for
other tasks capture these phenomena. Poliak et al.
(2018a) evaluated how well a BiLSTM encoder
trained as part of a neural machine translation
system capture phenomena like semantic proto-
roles, paraphrastic inference, and anaphora reso-
lution. Kim et al. (2019) used their RTE datasets

Mnttps://gluebenchmark.com/diagnostics

focused on function words to evaluate differ-
ent encoders trained for tasks like CCG pars-
ing, image-caption matching, predicting discourse
markers, and others. Those studies relied on the
use of auxiliary classifiers as a common prob-
ing technique to evaluate sentence representa-
tions. As the community’s interest in analyzing
deep learning systems increases, demonstrated by
the recent work relying on (Linzen et al., 2018,
2019) and improving upon (Hewitt and Liang,
2019; Voita and Titov, 2020; Pimentel et al., 2020;
Mu and Andreas, 2020) the popular auxiliary
classifier-based diagnostic technique, we call on
the community to leverage the increasing num-
ber of RTE datasets focused on different seman-
tic phenomena (Table 3) to thoroughly study the
representations learned by downstream, applied
NLP systems. The increasing number of RTE
datasets focused on different phenomena can help
researchers use one standard format to analyze
how well models capture different phenomena.

Another recent line of work uses RTE to eval-
uate the output of text generation systems. For
example, Falke et al. (2019) explore “whether tex-
tual entailment predictions can be used to detect
errors” in abstractive summarization systems and
if errors “can be reduced by reranking alternative
predicted summaries” with a textual entailment
system trained on SNLI. While Falke et al. (2019)
results demonstrated that current models might not
be accurate enough to rank generated summaries,
Barrantes et al. (2020) demonstrate that contem-
porary transformer models trained on the Adver-
sarial NLI dataset (Nie et al., 2020) “achieve sig-
nificantly higher accuracy and have the potential
of selecting a coherent summary.” Therefore, we
are encouraged that researchers might be able to
use many of these new RTE datasets focused on
specific phenomena to evaluate the coherency of
machine generated text based on multiple linguis-
tic phenomena that are integral to entailment and
NLU. This approach can help researchers use the
RTE datasets to evaluate a wider class of models,
specifically non-neural models, unlike the auxil-
iary classifier or probing methods previously dis-
cussed.

The overwhelming majority, if not all, of these
RTE datasets targeting specific phenomena rely on
categorical RTE labels, following the common for-
mat of the task. However, as Chen et al. (2020b)
recently illustrated, categorical RTE labels do not

stead, they argue for scalar RTE labels that in-
dicate how likely a hypothesis could be inferred
by a premise. Pavlick and Kwiatkowski (2019)
similarly lament how labels are currently used in
RTE datasets. Pavlick and Kwiatkowski demon-
Strate that a single label aggregated from multi-
ple annotations for one RTE example minimizes
the “type of uncertainty present in [valid] human
disagreements.” Instead, they argue that a “repre-
sentation should be evaluated in terms of its abil-
ity to predict the full distribution of human infer-
ences (e.g., by reporting crossentropy against a dis-
tribution of human ratings), rather than to predict
a single aggregate score (e.g., by reporting accu-
racy against a discrete majority label or correlation
with a mean score).” Future RTE datasets targeting
specific phenomena that contain scalar RTE labels
from multiple annotators (following Chen et al.
(2020a)’s and Pavlick and Kwiatkowski (2019)’s
recommendations) can provide even more insight
into contemporary NLP models.

6 Conclusion

With the current zeitgeist of NLP research where
researchers are interested in analyzing state-of-the-
art deep learning models, now is a prime time to
revisit RTE as a method to evaluate the inference
capabilities of NLP models. In this survey, we dis-
cussed recent advances in RTE datasets that focus
on specific linguistic phenomena that are integral
for determining whether one sentence is likely in-
ferred by another. Since RTE was primarily moti-
vated as an evaluation framework, we began this
survey with a broad overview of prior approaches
for evaluating NLP systems. This included the
distinctions between instrinsic vs extrinsic evalu-
ations and general purpose vs task specific evalua-

We discussed foundational RTE datasets that
greatly impacted the NLP community and in-
cluded critiques of why they do not fulfill the
promise of RTE as an evaluation framework. We
highlighted recent efforts to create RTE datasets
that focus on specific linguistic phenomena. By
using these datasets to evaluate sentence repre-
sentations from neural models or rank generated
text from NLP systems, researchers can help fulfil
the promise of RTE as unified evaluation frame-
work. Ultimately, this will help us determine how
well models understand language on a fine-grained
level.

A Pascal RTE Annotation Guidelines

In the first iteration of the PASCAL RTE challeges,
the task organizers were frank in their view that
they expected the task definition to change over
time. They wrote that “finally, the task definition
and evaluation methodologies are clearly not ma-
ture yet. We expect them to change over time and
hope that participants’ contributions, observations
and comments will help shaping this evolving re-
search direction.” Here, we include snippets from
the annotation guidelines for the first three PAS-
CAL RTE challenges:

A.1 RTE1 Guidelines

Given that the text and hypothesis might originate

from documents at different points in time, tense
aspects are ignored. In principle, the hypothe-
sis must be fully entailed by the text. Judgment
would be False if the hypothesis includes parts
that cannot be inferred from the text. However,
cases in which inference is very probable (but not
completely certain) are still judged at True.

Can neural networks understand monotonicity reasoning? reduce the risk of unclear cases, annotators

were guided to avoid vague examples for which
inference has some positive probability that is not
clearly very high. To keep the contexts in T and
HT self contained annotators replaced anaphors
with the appropriate reference from preceding sen-
tences where applicable. They also often short-
ened the hypotheses, and sometimes the texts, to
reduce complexity.

(Dagan et al., 2006)

A.2  RTE2 Guidelines

Local textual inference: Can it be defined or circumscribed?

In Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Empirical
Modeling of Semantic Equivalence and Entailment,
pages 31-36, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Association for
Computational Linguistics.

The data collection and annotation guidelines
were revised and expanded ... We say that t en-
tails h if, typically, a human reading t would infer
that h is most likely true. This somewhat informal
definition is based on (and assumes) common hu-
man understanding of language as well as com-
mon background knowledge. Textual entailment
recognition is the task of deciding, given t and h,
whether t entails h. Some additional judgment cri-
teria and guidelines are listed below:

¢ Entailment is a directional relation. The hy-
pothesis must be entailed from the given text,
but the text need not be entailed from the hy-
pothesis.

¢ The hypothesis must be fully entailed by the
text. Judgment would be NO if the hypothesis


includes parts that cannot be inferred from
the text.

Cases in which inference is very probable
(but not completely certain) are judged as
YES. For instance, in pair #387 one could
claim that although Shapiro’s office is in Cen-
tury City, he actually never arrives to his of-
fice, and works elsewhere. However, this in-
terpretation of t is very unlikely, and so the en-
tailment holds with high probability. On the
other hand, annotators were guided to avoid
vague examples for which inference has some
positive probability which is not clearly very
high.

Our definition of entailment allows presuppo-
sition of common knowledge, such as: a com-
pany has a CEO, a CEO is an employee of
the company, an employee is a person, etc.
For instance, in pair #294, the entailment
depends on knowing that the president of a
country is also a citizen of that country.

(Bar-Haim et al., 2006)

A.3 RTE3 Guidelines

As entailment is a directional relation, the hypoth-
esis must be entailed by the given text, but the text
need not be entailed by the hypothesis.

¢ The hypothesis must be fully entailed by the
text. Judgment must be NO if the hypothesis
includes parts that cannot be inferred from
the text.

Cases in which inference is very probable
(but not completely certain) were judged as
YES.

Common world knowledge was assumed, e.g.
the capital of a country is situated in that
country, the prime minister of a state is also
a citizen of that state, and so on.

(Giampiccolo et al., 2007)
