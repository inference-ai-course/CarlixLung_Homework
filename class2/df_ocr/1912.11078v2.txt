Abstract

An increasing number of natural language
processing papers address the effect of bias
on predictions, introducing mitigation tech-
niques at different parts of the standard NLP
pipeline (data and models). However, these
works have been conducted individually, with-
out a unifying framework to organize efforts
within the field. This situation leads to repet-
itive approaches, and focuses overly on bias
symptoms/effects, rather than on their origins,
which could limit the development of effective
countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a
unifying predictive bias framework for NLP.
We summarize the NLP literature and suggest
general mathematical definitions of predictive
bias. We differentiate two consequences of
bias: outcome disparities and error dispari-
ties, as well as four potential origins of bi-
ases: label bias, selection bias, model over-
amplification, and semantic bias. Our frame-
work serves as an overview of predictive bias
in NLP, integrating existing work into a single
structure, and providing a conceptual baseline
for improved frameworks.

1 Introduction

Predictive models in NLP are sensitive to a variety
of (often unintended) biases throughout the devel-
opment process. As a result, fitted models do not
generalize well, incurring performance and relia-
bility losses on unseen data. They also have so-
cially undesirable effects by systematically under-
serving or mispredicting certain user groups.

The general phenomenon of biased predictive
models in NLP is not recent. The community
has long worked on the domain adaptation prob-
lem (Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Daume III, 2007):
models fit on newswire data do not perform well
on social media and other text types. This prob-
lem arises from the tendency of statistical mod-
els to pick up on non-generalizable signals during

the training process. In the case of domains, these
non-generalizations are words, phrases, or senses
that occur in one text type, but not another.

However, this kind of variation is not just re-
stricted to text domains: it is a fundamental prop-
erty of human-generated language: we talk differ-
ently than our parents or people from a different
part of our country, etc. (Pennebaker and Stone,
2003; Eisenstein et al., 2010; Kern et al., 2016).
In other words, language reflects the diverse de-
mographics, backgrounds, and personalities of the
people who use it. While these differences are of-
ten subtle, they are distinct and cumulative (Trudg-
ill, 2000; Kern et al., 2016; Pennebaker, 2011).
Similar to text domains, this variation can lead
models to pick up on patterns that do not gener-
alize to other author-demographics, or to rely on
undesirable word-demographic relationships.

Bias may be an inherent property of any NLP
system (and broadly any statistical model), but
this is not per se negative. In essence, biases are
priors that inform our decisions (a dialogue sys-
tem designed for elders might work differently
than one for teenagers). Still, undetected and
unaddressed, biases can lead to negative conse-
quences: There are aggregate effects for demo-
graphic groups, which combine to produce predic-
tive bias. I.e., the label distribution of a predictive
model reflects a human attribute in a way that di-
verges from a theoretically defined “ideal distribu-
tion.” For example, a Part Of Speech (POS) tag-
ger reflecting how an older generation uses words
(Hovy and S¢gaard, 2015) diverges from the pop-
ulation as a whole.

A variety of papers have begun to address
countermeasures for predictive biases (Li et al.,
2018; Elazar and Goldberg, 2018; Coavoux et al.,
2018).! Each identifies a specific bias and counter-

measure on their terms, but it is often not explic-
itly clear which bias is addressed, where it orig-
inates, or how it generalizes. There are multi-
ple sources from which bias can arise within the
predictive pipeline, and methods proposed for one
specific bias often do not apply to another. As
a consequence, much work has focused on bias
effects and symptoms rather than their origins.
While it is essential to address the effects of bias, it
can leave the fundamental origin unchanged (Go-
nen and Goldberg, 2019), requiring researchers to
rediscover the issue over and over. The “bias” dis-
cussed in one paper may, therefore, be quite dif-
ferent than that in another.”

A shared definition and framework of predictive
bias can unify these efforts, provide a common ter-
minology, help to identify underlying causes, and
allow coordination of countermeasures (Sun et al.,
2019). However, such a general framework had
yet to be proposed within the NLP community.

To address these problems, we suggest a joint
conceptual framework, depicted in Figure 1, out-
lining and relating the different origins of bias.
We base our framework on an extensive survey
of the relevant NLP literature, informed by se-

of this biased-focused paper. Note also that while bias is an
ethical issue and contributes to many papers in the ethics in
NLP area, the two should not be conflated: ethics covers more
than bias.

Quantitative social science offers a background for
bias (Berk, 1983). However, NLP differs fundamentally in
analytic goals (namely out-of-sample prediction for NLP ver-
sus parameter inference for hypothesis testing in social sci-
ence) that bring about NLP-specific situations: biases in word
embeddings, annotator labels, or predicting over-amplified
demographics.

lected works in social science and adjacent fields.
We identify four distinct sources of bias: selec-
tion bias, label bias, model overamplification,
and semantic bias. We can express all of these as
differences between (a) a “true” or intended distri-
bution (e.g., over users, labels, or outcomes), and
(b) the distribution used or produced by the model.
These cases arise at specific points within a typical
predictive pipeline: embeddings, source data, la-
bels (human annotators), models, and target data.
We provide quantitative definitions of predictive
bias in this framework intended to make it easier
to: (a) identify biases (because they can be clas-
sified), (b) develop countermeasures (because the
underlying problem is known), and (c) compare
biases and countermeasures across papers. We
hope this paper will help researchers spot, com-
pare, and address bias in all its various forms.

Contributions Our primary contributions in-
clude: (1) a conceptual framework for identify-
ing and quantifying predictive bias and its origins
within a standard NLP pipeline, (2) a survey of bi-
ases identified in NLP models, and (3) a survey
of methods for countering bias in NLP organized
within our conceptual framework.

2 Definition - Two Types of Disparities

Our definition of predictive bias in NLP builds on
its definition within the literature on standardized
testing (i.e., SAT, GRE, etc.) Specifically, Swinton
(1981) states:

By “predictive bias," we refer to a situation in

which a [predictive model] is used to predict a


specific criterion for a particular population, and
is found to give systematically different predic-
tions for subgroups of this population who are in

fact identical on that specific criterion.*

We generalize Swinton’s definition in two ways:
First, to align notation with standard supervised
modeling, we say there are both Y (a random
variable representing the “true” values of an out-
come) and Y (a random variable representing the
predictions. Next, we allow the concept to apply
to differences associated with continuously-valued
human attributes rather than simply discrete sub-
groups of people.* Below, we define two types of
measurable systematic differences (i.e. “dispari-
ties”): (1) a systematic difference between Y and
Y ( outcome disparity) and (2) a difference in error
(e=|Y- Y) error disparity, both as a function of
a given human attribute, A.

Outcome disparity. Formally, we say an out-
come disparity exists for outcome, Y, a domain
D (with values source or target), and with re-
spect to attribute, A, when the distribution of the
predicted outcome (Q(Yp|Ap)) is dissimilar to a
given theoretical ideal distribution (P(Yp|Ap)):

Q(Yp|Ap) ~ P(Yp|Ap)

The ideal distribution is specific to the target
application. Our framework allows researchers to
use their own criteria to determine this distribu-
tion. However, the task of doing so may be non-
trivial. First, the current distribution within a pop-
ulation may not be accessible. Even when it is, it
may not be what most consider the ideal distribu-
tion (e.g., the distribution of gender in computer
science and the associated disparity of NLP mod-
els attributing male pronouns to computer scien-
tists more frequently (Hovy, 2015)). Second, it
may be difficult to come to an agreed-upon ideal
distribution from a moral or ethical perspective. In
such a case, it may be helpful to use an ideal “di-
rection,” rather than specifying a specific distribu-
tion (e.g., moving toward a uniform distribution of

3We have substituted “test" with “predictive model”.

*“A tributes” include both continuously valued user-level
variables, like age, personality on a 7-point scale, etc. (also
referred to as “dimensional” or “factors”’), and discrete cat-
egories like membership in an ethnic group. Psychological
research suggests that people are better represented by con-
tinuously valued scores, where possible, than discrete cate-
gories (Baumeister et al., 2007; Widiger and Samuel, 2005;
McCrae and Costa Jr., 1989). In NLP, Lynn et al. (2017)
shows benefits from treating user-level attributes as contin-
uously when integrating into NLP models.

pronouns associated with computer science). Our
framework should enable its users to apply evolv-
ing standards and norms across NLP’s many ap-
plication contexts.

A prototypical example of outcome disparity
is gender disparity in image captions. Zhao et al.
(2017) and Hendricks et al. (2018) demonstrate
a systematic difference with respect to gender in
the outcome of the model, Y even when taking
the source distribution as an ideal target distribu-
tion: O( Yienger | gender) oe Q(Yiarget|gender ) ~
Q(Ysource|gender). As a result, captions over-
predict females in images with ovens and males
in images with snowboards.

Error disparity. We say there is an error dis-
parity when model predictions have larger error
for individuals with a given user attribute (or range
of attributes in the case of continuously-valued at-
tributes). Formally, the error of a predicted distri-
bution is

ep =|Yp — Yp|

If there is a difference in €p over at least two dif-
ferent values of an attribute A (assuming they have
been adequately sampled to establish a distribution
of €p) then there is an error disparity.

Q(ep|Ai) * Q(ed|Aj)

In other words, the error for one group might
systematically differ from the error for another
group, e.g., the error for green people differs
from the error for blue people. Under unbiased
conditions, the difference would be equal. This
formulation allows us to capture both the discrete
case (arguably more common in NLP, for exam-
ple, in POS tagging) and the continuous case (for
example, in age or income prediction).

We propose that if either of these two dis-
parities exist in our target application, then there
is a predictive bias. Note that predictive bias is
then a property of a model given a specific appli-
cation, rather than merely an intrinsic property
of the model by itself. This definition mirrors
predictive bias in standardized testing (Swinton,
1981): “a [predictive model] cannot be called
biased without reference to a specific prediction
situation; thus, the same instrument may be biased
in one application, but unbiased in another."

A prototypical example of error disparity is
the “Wall Street Journal Effect” — a systematic


difference in error as a function of demograph-
ics, first documented by Hovy and Sggaard (2015).
In theory, POS tagging errors increase the further
an author’s demographic attributes differ from the
average WSJ author of the 1980s and 1990s (on
whom many POS taggers were trained — a selec-
tion bias, discussed next). Work by Sap et al.
(2019) shows error disparity from a different ori-
gin, namely unfairness in hate speech detection.
They find that annotators for hate speech on so-
cial media make more mistakes on posts of black
individuals. Contrary to the case above, the dis-
parity is not necessarily due to a difference be-
tween author and annotator population (a selection
bias). Instead, the label disparity stems from an-
notators failing to account for the authors’ racial
background and sociolinguistic norms.

Source and Target Populations. An important
assumption of our framework is that disparities are
dependent on the population for which the model
will be applied. This assumption is reflected in
distinguishing a separate “target population” from
the “source population” on which the model was
trained. In cross-validation over random folds,
models are trained and tested over the same popu-
lation. However, in practice, models are often ap-
plied to novel data that may originate from a dif-
ferent population of people. In other words, the
disparity may exist as a model property for one
application, but not for another.

Quantifying disparity. Given the definitions of
the two types of disparities, we can quantify bias
with well-established measures of distributional
divergence or deviance. Specifically, we suggest
the Log-likelihood ratio as a central metric:

D(Y,Y|A) = 2(log(p(¥|A)) — log(v(¥|A)))

where p(Y|A) is the specified ideal distribution
(either derived empirically or theoretically) and
p(Y|A) is the distribution within the data. For
error disparity the ideal distribution is always the
Uniform and Y is replaced with the error. KL di-
vergence (Dic,[P(Y|A)P(Y|A)]}) can be used as
a secondary, more scalable alternative.

Our measure above attempts to synthesize met-
rics others have used in works focused on specific
biases. For example, the definition of outcome dis-
parity is analogous to that used for semantic bias.
Kurita et al. (2019) quantify bias in embeddings
as the difference in log probability score when re-

placing words suspected to carry semantic differ-
ences (‘he’, ‘she’) with a mask:

log(P([Mask] = “(PRON)” |[Mask] is “(NOUN)”)) —
log(P([Mask] = “(PRON)” |[Mask] is [Mask])))

(NOUN) is replaced with a specific noun to
check for semantic bias (e.g., an occupation),
and (PRON) is an associated demographic word
(e.g., “he” or “she’’).

3 Four Origins of Bias

But what leads to an outcome disparity or er-
ror disparity? We identify four points within the
standard supervised NLP pipeline where bias may
originate: (1) the training labels (label bias), (2)
the samples used as observations — for training
or testing (selection bias), (3) the representation of
data (semantic bias), or (4) due to the fit method
itself (overamplification).

Label Bias Label bias emerges when the distri-
bution of the dependent variable in the data source
diverges substantially from the ideal distribution:

Q(¥s|As) ~ P(¥s|As)

Here, the labels themselves are erroneous concern-
ing the demographic attribute of interest (as com-
pared to the source distribution). Sometimes, this
bias is due to a non-representative group of anno-
tators (Joseph et al., 2017). In other cases, it may
be due to a lack of domain expertise (Plank et al.,
2014), or due to preconceived notions and stereo-
types held by the annotators (Sap et al., 2019).

Selection bias. Selection bias emerges due to
non-representative observations. I.e., when the
users generating the training (source) observa-
tions differ from the user distribution of the tar-
get, where the model will be applied. Selection
bias (sometimes also referred to as sample bias)
has long been a concern in the social sciences. At
this point, testing for such a bias is a fundamen-
tal consideration in study design (Berk, 1983; Cu-
lotta, 2014). Non-representative data is the origin
for selection bias.

Within NLP, some of the first works to
note demographic biases were due to a selec-
tion bias (Hovy and Sggaard, 2015; Jgrgensen
et al., 2015). A prominent example is the
so-called “Wall Street Journal effect’, where
syntactic parsers and part-of-speech taggers are
most accurate over language written by middle-
aged white men. The effect occurs because


this group happened to be the predominant au-
thors’ demographics of the WSJ articles, which
are traditionally used to train syntactic mod-
els (Garimella et al., 2019). The same effect was
reported for language identification difficulties for
African-American Vernacular English (Blodgett
and O’Connor, 2017; Jurgens et al., 2017).

The predicted output is dissimilar from the ideal
distribution, leading, for example, to lower accu-
racy for a given demographic, since the source
did not reflect the ideal distribution. We say that
the distribution of human attribute, A, within the
source data, s, is dissimilar to the distribution of A
within the target data, t:

Q(As) » P(A:)

Selection bias has several peculiarities. First, it
is dependent on the ideal distribution of the target
population, so a model may have selection bias for
one application (and its associated target popula-
tion), but not for another. Also, consider that ei-
ther the source features (X,) or source labels (Y;)
may be non-representative. In many situations,
the distributions for the features and labels are the
same. However, there are some cases where they
diverge. For example, when using features from
age-biased tweets, but labels from non-biased cen-
sus surveys. In such cases, we need to take multi-
ple analysis levels into account: corrections can be
applied to user features as they are aggregated to
communities (Almodaresi et al., 2017). The con-
sequences could be both outcome and error dis-
parity.

One of the challenges in addressing selection
bias is that we can not know a priori what sort of
(demographic) attribute will be important to con-
trol. Age and gender are well-studied, but others
might be less obvious. We might someday real-
ize that a formerly innocuous attribute (say, hand-
edness) turns out to be relevant for selection bi-
ases. This problem is known as The Known and
Unknown Unknowns.

As we know, there are known knowns:
there are things we know we know. We
also know there are known unknowns:
that is to say, we know there are some
things we do not know. But there are
also unknown unknowns: the ones we
don’t know we don’t know.

ness and annotation quality

We will see later how better documentation can
help future researchers address this problem.

Overamplification. Another source of bias can
occur even when there is no label or selection
bias. In overamplification, a model relies on a
small difference between human attributes with re-
spect to the objective (even an acceptable differ-
ence matching the ideal distribution), but amplifies
this difference to be much more pronounced in the
predicted outcomes. The origins of overamplifica-
tion are during learning itself. The model learns
to pick up on imperfect evidence for the outcome,
which brings out the bias.

Formally, in overamplification the predicted
distribution (Q(Y,|Ag)) is dissimilar to the source
training distribution (Q(Y;|As)) with respect to a
human attribute, A. The predicted distribution is
therefore also dissimilar to the target ideal distri-
bution:

Q(Ys|As) » Q(¥s|As) ~ P(Y:/At)

For example, Yatskar et al. (2016) found that
in the imSitu image captioning data set, 58% of
captions involving a person in a kitchen mention
women. However, standard models trained on
such data end up predicting people depicted in
kitchens as women 63% of the time (Zhao et al.,
2017). In other words, an error in generating a
gender reference within the text (e.g., “A [woman
|| man] standing next to a counter-top”) males an
incorrect female reference much more common.

The occurrence of overamplification in the ab-
sence of other biases is an important motivation
for countermeasures. It does not require bias on
the part of the annotator, data collector, or even
the programmer/data analyst (though it can es-
calate existing biases and the models’ statistical
discrimination along a demographic dimension).
In particular, it extends countermeasures beyond
the point some authors have made, that they are


merely cosmetic and do not address the underly-
ing cause: biased language in society (Gonen and
Goldberg, 2019).

Semantic bias. Embeddings (i.e., vectors repre-
senting the meaning of words or phrases) have be-
come a mainstay of modern NLP, providing more
flexible representations that feed both traditional
and deep learning models. However, these repre-
sentations often contain unintended or undesirable
associations and societal stereotypes (e.g., con-
necting medical doctors more frequently to male
pronouns than female pronouns, see Bolukbasi
et al. (2016); Caliskan et al. (2017)). We adopt
the term used for this phenomenon by others, “‘se-
mantic bias”.

Formally, we attribute semantic bias to the pa-
rameters of the embedding model (6¢,,»). Seman-
tic bias is a unique case since it indirectly af-
fects both outcome disparity and error disparity
by creating other biases, such as overamplifica-
tion (Yatskar et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017) or di-
verging words associations within embeddings or
language models (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Rudinger
et al., 2018). However, we distinguish it from the
other biases, since the population does not have to
be people, but rather words in contexts that yield
non-ideal associations. For example, the issue is
not (only) that a particular gender authors more
of the training data for the embeddings. Instead,
that gendered pronouns are mentioned alongside
occupations according to a non-ideal distribution
(e.g., texts talk more about male doctors and fe-
male nurses than vice versa). Furthermore, pre-
trained embeddings are often used without access
to the original data (or the resources to process
it). We thus suggest that embedding models them-
selves are a distinct source of bias within NLP pre-
dictive pipelines.

They have consequently received increased at-
tention, with dedicated sessions at NAACL and
ACL 2019. As an example, Kurita et al. (2019)
quantify human-like bias in BERT. Using the Gen-
der Pronoun Resolution (GPR) task, they find that,
even after balancing the data set, the model pre-
dicts no female pronouns with high probability.
Semantic bias is also of broad interest to the social
sciences as a diagnostic tool (see Section A). How-
ever, their inclusion in our framework is not for
reasons of social scientific diagnostics, but rather
to guide mindful researchers where to look for
problems.

Multiple Biases. Biases occur not only in isola-
tion, but they also compound to increase their ef-
fects. Label and selection bias can — and often do
— interact, so it can be challenging to distinguish
them. Table 1 shows the different conditions to
understand the boundaries of one or another.
Consider the case where a researcher chooses
to balance a sentiment data set for a user attribute,
e.g., age. This decision can directly impact the
label distribution of the target variable. E.g., be-
cause the positive label is over-represented in a mi-
nority age group. Models learn to exploit this con-
founding correlation between age and label preva-
lence and magnify it even more. The resulting
model may be useless, as it only captures the dis-
tribution in the synthetic data sample. We see
this situation in early work on using social media
data to predict mental health conditions. Models
to distinguish PTSD from depression turned out
to mainly capture the differences in user age and
gender, rather than language reflecting the actual
conditions (Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2015).

3.1 Other Bias Definitions and Frameworks

While this is the first attempt at a comprehensive
conceptual framework for bias in NLP, alternative
frameworks exist, both in other fields and based on
more qualitative definitions. Friedler et al. (2016)
define bias as unfairness in algorithms. They spec-
ify the idea of a “construct” space, which captures
the latent features in the data that help predict the
right outcomes. They suggest that finding those
latent variables would also enable us to produce
the right outcomes. Hovy and Spruit (2016) take
a broader scope on bias based on ethics in new
technologies. They list three qualitative sources
(data, modeling, and research design), and sug-
gest three corresponding types of biases: demo-
graphic bias, overgeneralization, and topic expo-
sure. Suresh and Guttag (2019) propose a qualita-
tive framework for bias in machine learning, defin-
ing bias as a “potential harmful property of the
data”. They categorize bias into historical bias,
representation bias, measurement bias, and evalu-
ation bias. Glymour and Herington (2019) clas-
sify algorithmic bias, in general, into four dif-
ferent categories, depending on the causal condi-
tional dependencies to which it is sensitive: pro-
cedural bias, outcome bias, behavior-relative er-
ror bias, and score-relative error bias. Corbett-
Davies and Goel (2018) propose statistical limi-
tations of the three prominent definitions of fair-


ness (anti-classification, classification parity, and
calibration), enabling researchers to develop fairer
machine learning algorithms.

Our framework focuses on NLP, but it follows
Glymour and Herington (2019) in providing prob-
abilistic based definitions of bias. It incorporates
and formalizes the above to varying degrees.

In social sciences, bias definitions often relate
to the ability to test causal hypotheses. Hernan
et al. (2004) propose a common structure for var-
ious types of selection bias. They define bias as
the difference between a variable and the outcome,
and the causal effect of a variable on the outcome.
E.g., when the causal risk ratio (CRR) differs from
associational risk ratio (ARR). Similarly, Baker
et al. (2013) define bias as uncontrolled covariates
or “disturbing variables” that are related to mea-
sures of interest.

Others provide definitions restricted to partic-
ular applications. For example, Caliskan et al.
(2017) propose the Word-Embedding Association
Test (WEAT). It quantifies semantic bias based
on the distance between words with demographic
associations in the embedding space. The previ-
ously mentioned work by Kurita et al. (2019) and
Sweeney and Najafian (2019) extend such mea-
sures. Similarly, Romanov et al. (2019) define
bias based on the correlation between the embed-
dings of human attributes with the difference in
the True Positive rates between human traits. This
approach is reflective of an error disparity.

Our framework encompasses bias-related work
in the social sciences. Please see the supplement
in A.1 for a brief overview.

4 Countermeasures

We group proposed countermeasures based on the
origin(s) on which they act.

Label Bias. There are several ways to address
label bias, typically by controlling for biases of
the annotators (Pavlick et al., 2014). Disagree-
ment between annotators has long been an active
research area in NLP, with various approaches to
measure and quantify disagreement through inter-
annotator agreement (IAA) scores to remove out-
liers (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). Lately, there
has been more of an emphasis on embracing vari-
ation through the use of Bayesian annotation mod-
els (Hovy et al., 2013; Passonneau and Carpenter,
2014; Paun et al., 2018). These models arrive at a
much less biased estimate for the final label than

majority voting, by attaching confidence scores
to each annotator, and reweighting them through
that method. Other approaches have explored har-
nessing the inherent disagreement among anno-
tators to guide the training process (Plank et al.,
2014). By weighting updates by the amount of
disagreement on the labels, this method prevents
bias towards any one label. The weighted up-
dates act as a regularizer during training, which
might also help prevent overamplification. If an-
notators behave in predictable ways to produce ar-
tifacts (i.e., always add “not” to form a contradic-
tion), we can train a model on such biased fea-
tures and use it in ensemble learning (Clark et al.,
2019). Hays et al. (2015) attempt to make Web
studies equivalent to representative focus group
panels. They give an overview of probabilistic
and non-probabilistic approaches to generate the
Internet panels that contribute to the data gener-
ation. Along with the six demographic attributes
(age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital sta-
tus, and income), they use poststratification to re-
duce the bias (some of these methods cross into
addressing selection bias).

Selection bias. The primary source for selection
bias is the mismatch between the sample distribu-
tion and the ideal distribution. Consequently, any
countermeasures need to re-align the two distribu-
tions to minimize this mismatch.

The easiest way to address the mismatch is to
re-stratify the data to more closely match the ideal
distribution. However, this often involves down-
sampling an overly represented class, which re-
duces the number of available instances. Moham-
mady and Culotta (2014) use a stratified sampling
technique to reduce the selection bias in the data.
Almeida et al. (2015) use demographic user at-
tributes, including age, gender, and social status,
to predict the election results in six different cities
of Brazil. They use stratified sampling on all the
resulting groups to reduce selection bias.

Rather than re-sampling, others use reweighting
or poststratifying to reduce selection bias. Cu-
lotta (2014) estimates county-level health statis-
tics based on social media data. He shows we
can stratify based on external socio-demographic
data about a community’s composition (e.g., gen-
der and race). Park et al. (2006) estimate state-
wise public opinions using the National Surveys
corpus. To reduce bias, they use various socioe-
conomic and demographic attributes (state of res-


idence, sex, ethnicity, age, and education level) in
a multilevel logistic regression. Choy et al. (2011)
and Choy et al. (2012) also use race and gender
as features for reweighting in predicting the re-
sults of the Singapore and US presidential elec-
tions. Baker et al. (2013) study how selection bias
manifests in inferences for a larger population, and
how to avoid it. Apart from the basic demographic
attributes, they also consider attitudinal and be-
havioral attributes for the task. They suggest us-
ing reweighting, ranking reweighting or propen-
sity score adjustment, and sample-matching tech-
niques to reduce selection bias.

Others have suggested combinations of these
approaches. Hernan et al. (2004), propose Di-
rected Acyclic graphs for various heterogeneous
types of selection bias, and suggest using stratified
sampling, regression adjustment, or inverse prob-
ability weighting to avoid the bias in the data. Za-
gheni and Weber (2015), study the use of Internet
Data for demographic studies and propose two ap-
proaches to reduce the selection bias in their task.
If the ground truth is available, they adjust selec-
tion bias based on the calibration of a stochastic
microsimulation. If unavailable, they suggest us-
ing a difference-in-differences technique to find
out trends on the Web.

Zmigrod et al. (2019) show that gender-based
selection bias could be addressed by data augmen-
tation, i.e., by adding slightly altered examples to
the data. This addition addresses selection bias
originating in the features (X source), So that the
model is fit on a more gender-representative sam-
ple. Their approach is similar to the reweighting
of poll data based on demographics, which can
be applied more directly to tweet-based population
surveillance (see our last case study, A.2).

Li et al. (2018) introduce a model-based coun-
termeasure. They use an adversarial multitask-
learning setup to model demographic attributes as
auxiliary tasks explicitly. By reversing the gradi-
ent for those tasks during backpropagation, they
effectively force the model to ignore confound-
ing signals associated with the demographic at-
tributes. Apart from improving overall perfor-
mance across demographics, they show that it also
protects user privacy. The findings from Elazar
and Goldberg (2018), however, suggest that even
with adversarial training, internal representations
still retain traces of demographic information.

Overamplification. In its simplest form, over-
amplification of inherent bias by the model can be
corrected by downweighting the biased instances
in the sample, to discourage the model from exag-
gerating the effects.

A common approach involves using synthetic
matched distributions. To address gender bias in
neural network approaches to coreference resolu-
tion Rudinger et al. (2018); Zhao et al. (2018) sug-
gest matching the label distributions in the data,
and training the model on the new data set. They
swap male and female instances and merge them
with the original data set for training. In the
same vein, Webster et al. (2018) provide a gender-
balanced training corpus for coreference resolu-
tion. Based on the first two corpora, Stanovsky
et al. (2019) introduce a bias evaluation for ma-
chine translation, showing that most systems over-
amplify gender bias (see also Prates et al. (2018)).
Hovy et al. (2020) show that this overamplifica-
tion consistently makes translations sound older
and more male than the original authors.

Several authors have suggested it is essential for
language to be understood within the context of
the author and their social environment Jurgens
(2013); Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013);
Hovy (2018); Yang et al. (2019). Considering
the author demographics improves the accuracy of
text classifiers Volkova et al. (2013); Hovy (2015);
Lynn et al. (2017), and in turn, could lead to de-
creased error disparity.

Semantic bias. Countermeasures for semantic
bias in embeddings typically attempt to adjust the
parameters of the embedding model to reflect a tar-
get distribution more accurately. Because all of the
above techniques can be applied for model fitting,
here we highlight techniques that are more specific
to addressing bias in embeddings.

Bolukbasi et al. (2016) suggest that techniques
to de-bias embeddings can be classified into two
approaches: hard de-biasing (completely removes
bias) and soft de-biasing (partially removes bias
avoiding side effects). Romanov et al. (2019) gen-
eralize this work to a multi-class setting, exploring
methods to mitigate bias in an occupation classifi-
cation task. They reduce the correlation between
the occupation of people and the word embedding
of their names, and manage to simultaneously re-
duce race and gender biases without reducing the
classifier’s performance. Manzini et al. (2019),
identify the bias subspace using principal compo-


nent analysis and remove the biased components
using hard Neutralize and Equalize de-biasing and
soft biasing methods proposed by Bolukbasi et al.
(2016). The above examples evaluate success
through the semantic analogy task (Mikolov et al.,
2013), a method whose informativeness has since
been questioned, though (Nissim et al., 2019). For
a dedicated overview of semantic de-biasing tech-
niques see Lauscher et al. (2020).

Social-Level Mitigation. Several initiatives
propose standardized documentation to trace
potential biases, and to ultimately mitigate them.
Data Statements Bender and Friedman (2018)
suggest clearly disclosing data selection, an-
notation, and curation processes explicitly and
transparently. Similarly, Gebru et al. (2018)
suggest Datasheets to cover the lifecycle of
data including “motivation for dataset creation;
dataset composition; data collection process; data
preprocessing; dataset distribution; dataset main-
tenance; and legal and ethical considerations”.
Mitchell et al. (2019) extend this idea to include
model specifications and performance details on
different user groups. Hitti et al. (2019) propose a
taxonomy for assessing the gender bias of a data
set. While these steps do not directly mitigate
bias, they can encourage researchers to identify
and communicate sources of label or selection
bias. Such documentation, combined with a
conceptual framework to guide specific mitiga-
tion techniques, acts as an essential mitigation
technique at the level of the research community.

See Appendix A.2 for case studies outlining
various types of bias in several NLP tasks.

5 Conclusion

We present a comprehensive overview of the re-
cent literature on predictive bias in NLP. Based
on this survey, we develop a unifying conceptual
framework to describe bias sources and their ef-
fects (rather than just their effects). This frame-
work allows us to group and compare works on
countermeasures. Rather than giving the impres-
sion that bias is a growing problem, we would like
to point out that bias is not necessarily something
gone awry, but rather something nearly inevitable
in statistical models. We do, however, stress that
we need to acknowledge and address bias with
proactive measures. Having a formal framework
of the causes can help us achieve this.

We would like to leave the reader with these
main points: (1) every predictive model with er-
rors is bound to have disparities over human at-
tributes (even those not directly integrating human
attributes); (2) disparities can result from a vari-
ety of origins — the embedding model, the feature
sample, the fitting process, and the outcome sam-
ple — within the standard predictive pipeline; (3)
selection of “protected attributes” (or human at-
tributes along which to avoid biases) is necessary
for measuring bias, and often helpful for mitigat-
ing bias and increasing the generalization ability
of the models.

We see this paper as a step toward a unified un-
derstanding of bias in NLP. We hope it inspires
further work in both identifying and countering
bias, as well as conceptually and mathematically
defining bias in NLP.

Framework Application Steps (TL;DR)

1. Specify target population and an ideal
distribution of the attribute (A) to be
investigated for bias; Consult datasheets and
data statements? if available for the model
source;

2. If outcome disparity or error disparity,
check for potential origins:

(a) if label bias: use post-stratification or
retrain annotators.

(b) if selection bias: use stratified sampling
to match source to target populations,
or use post-stratification, re-weighting
techniques.

(c) if overamplification: synthetically
match distributions or add outcome
disparity to cost function.

(d) if semantic bias: retrain or retrofit
embeddings considering approaches
above, but with attributed (e.g.,
gendered) words (rather than people) as
the population.

A Appendices
A.1 Related Work in Other Fields

We survey the literature of adjacent fields and out-
line different streams related to our framework.
These examples illustrate the ubiquity and com-
plexity of bias, and highlight its understanding in
different disciplines over time.

Bias became a crucial topic in social science
following the seminal work of Tversky and Kah-
neman, showing that human thinking was sub-
ject to systematic errors (Tversky and Kahneman,
1973). Human logic was seemingly separate from
the principles of probability calculus. “Bias” here
is interpreted as the result of psychological heuris-
tics, i.e., mental “shortcuts” to help us react faster
to situations. While many of these heuristics can
be useful in critical situations, their indiscrimi-
nate application in everyday life can have adverse
effects and cause bias. This line of work has
spawned an entire field of study in psychology (de-
cision making).

The focus of Tversky and Kahneman (1973)
(and a whole field of decision making that fol-
lowed) was human behavior. Still, the same ba-
sic principles of systematic differences in deci-
sion making apply to machines as well. How-
ever, algorithms also provide systematic ways to
reduce bias, and some see the mitigation of bias
in algorithm decisions as a potential opportunity
to move the needle positively (Kleinberg et al.,
2018). Thus, we can apply frameworks of contem-
poraries in human behavior to machines (Rahwan
et al., 2019), and perhaps benefit from a more scal-
able experimentation process. Costello and Watts
(2014) studies human judgment under uncertain
conditions, and proposes that we can algorithmi-
cally account for observed human bias, provided
there is sufficient random noise in the probabilistic
model. This view suggests bias within the model
itself, what we have called overamplification.

Still, most works on bias in decision making as-
sume working with unbiased data, even though so-
cial science has long battled selection bias. Most
commonly, data selection is heavily skewed to-
wards the students found on western university
campuses (Henrich et al., 2010). Attempts to rem-
edy selection bias in a scalable fashion use online
populations, which in turn are skewed by unequal
access to the Internet, but which we can mitigate
through reweighting schemes (Couper, 2013).

In some cases, algorithmic bias has helped un-
derstand society better. For example, semantic
bias in word embeddings has been leveraged to
track trends in societal attitudes concerning gender
roles and ethnic stereotypes. Garg et al. (2018);
Kozlowski et al. (2018) measure the distance be-
tween certain sets of words in different decades to
track this change. This use of biased embeddings
illustrates an interesting distinction between nor-
mative and descriptive ethics. When used in pre-
dictive models, semantic bias is something to be
avoided (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Le., it is norma-
tively wrong for many applications (e.g., we ide-
ally would want all genders or ethnicities equally
associated with all jobs). However, the works by
Garg et al. (2018) and Kozlowski et al. (2018)
show that it is precisely this bias of word em-
beddings that reflects societal attitudes. Here, the
presence of bias is descriptively correct. Simi-
larly, Bhatia (2017) uses this property of word em-
beddings to measure people’s psychological biases
and attitudes towards making individual decisions.

A.2 Discussion: Example Case Studies

Part of Speech Taggers and Parsing. The
works by Hovy and Sggaard (2015); Jgrgensen
et al. (2015) outline the effect of selection bias
on syntactic tools. The language of demographic
groups systematically differs from each other for
syntactic attributes. Therefore, models trained
on samples whose demographic composition (e.g.,
age and ethnicity) differs from the target per-
form significantly worse. Within the predictive
bias framework, the consequence of this selection
bias is an error disparity — Q(€p=general|A =
age, ethnicity) ~ Uniform, the error of the
model across a general domain (D) is not uni-
form with respect to attributes (A) age and ethnic-
ity. Li et al. (2018) shows that this consequence
of selection bias can be addressed by adversarial
learning, removing the age gap and significantly
reducing the performance difference between eth-
nolects (even if it was not trained with that objec-
tive). Garimella et al. (2019) quantifies this bias
further by studying the effect of different gender
compositions of the training data on tagging and
parsing, supporting the claim that debiased sam-
ples benefit performance.

Image Captions. Hendricks et al. (2018) shows
the presence of gender bias in image captioning,
overamplifying differences present in the train-


ing data. Prior work focused on context (e.g.,
it is easier to predict “mouse” when there is a
computer present). This bias manifests in ig-
noring people present in the image. The gen-
der bias is not only influenced by the images,
but also by biased language models. The pri-
mary consequence is an outcome disparity —
Q(Yp|gender) ~ P(Yp|gender), the distribu-
tion of outcomes (i.e. caption words and phrases)
produced from the model Q(Yp|gender) over-
selects particular phrases beyond the distribution
observed in reality: (i.e. P(Yp|gender); this is
true even when the source and target are the same:
D = source = target).

To overcome the bias and to increase perfor-
mance, Hendricks et al. (2018) introduce an equal-
izer model with two loss-terms: Appearance Con-
fusion Loss (ACL) and Confident Loss (Conf).
ACL increases the gender confusion when gen-
der information is not present in the image, mak-
ing it difficult to predict an accurately gendered
word. Confident loss increases the confidence of
the predicted gendered word when gender infor-
mation is present in the image. Both loss terms
have the effect of decreasing the difference be-
tween Q(Yp|gender) and P(Yp|gender). In the
end, the Equalizer model performs better in pre-
dicting a woman while still misclassifying a man
as a woman, but decreasing error disparity overall.

Sentiment Analysis. Kiritchenko and Moham-
mad (2018) show the issues of both semantic bias
and overamplification. They assess scoring dif-
ferences in 219 sentiment analysis systems by
switching out names and pronouns. (They switch
between male and female pronouns, and between
prototypical white and black American first names
based on name registers.) The results show that
male pronouns are associated with higher scores
for negative polarity, and prototypical black names
with higher scores for negative emotions. The con-
sequence of the semantic bias and overamplifica-
tion are outcome disparities: Q(Yp|gender) ~
P(Yp|gender) and Q(Yp|race) ~ P(Yp|race).
This finding again demonstrates a case of descrip-
tive vs. normative ethics. We could argue that
because aggression is more often associated with
male protagonists, the models reflect a descrip-
tively correct (if morally objectionable) societal
fact. However, if the model score changes based
on ethnicity, the difference likely reflects (and am-
plifies) societal ethnic stereotypes. Those stereo-

types, though, are both normatively and descrip-
tively wrong.

Differential Diagnosis in Mental Health. In
the clinical community, differentiating a subject
with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from
someone with depression is known to be difficult.
It was, therefore, surprising when early work on
this task produced AUCs greater than 0.85 (this
and similar tasks were part of the CLPsych2015
Shared task; (Coppersmith et al., 2015)). Labels of
depression and PTSD had been automatically de-
rived from a convenience sample of individuals®
who had publicly stated their diagnosis in their
profile. The task included a 50/50 split from each
category. However, Preotiuc-Pietro et al. (2015)
show that these classifiers primarily picked up on
differences in age or gender — subjects with PTSD
were more likely to be older than those with de-
pression. While age and gender themselves are
valid information for mental health diagnosis, the
design yielded classifiers that predicted nearly all
older individuals to have PTSD, and those younger
to have depression, despite the 50/50 split. These
classifiers resulted in outcome disparity, because
older individuals were much less likely to be la-
beled depressed than the target population (and
younger less likely for PTSD: Q(Yp|.A = age) ~
P(Yp|A = age)). In the end, the task orga-
nizers mitigated the issue by using matched con-
trols — adding another 50% samples for each class
such that the age and gender distributions of both
groups matched. Recently, Benton et al. (2017)
showed that accounting for demographic attributes
in the model could leverage this correlation while
controlling for the confounds.

Assessing Demographic Variance in Language.
A final case study in applying our framework
demonstrates how inferring user demographics
can mitigate bias. Consider the task of produc-
ing population measurements from readily avail-
able (but biased) community corpora. E.g., as-
sessing representative US county life satisfaction
from tweets (Schwartz et al., 2013). Unlike our
other examples, the outcomes of the source train-
ing data (i.e., surveys) are expected to be represen-
tative, while the features come with biases. The
source feature distributions with respect to human
attributes are dissimilar from the ideal distribu-

for the given task.


tion, while the source outcomes match that tar-
get outcomes (Q(X source|A) % P(Xtarget|A) but
Q(Y seurce|A) ~ P(Ytarget|A)).

In this case, the effectiveness of countermea-
sures preventing selection and semantic biases (for
X source and Xtarget) should result in increased
predictive performance against a representative
community outcome. Indeed, Giorgi et al. (2019)
adjust the feature estimates, X, to match represen-
tative demographics and socio-economics by us-
ing inferred user attributes, and find improved pre-
dictions for the life satisfaction of a Twitter com-
munity.
