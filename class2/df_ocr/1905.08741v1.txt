Abstract

1905.08741v1 [hep-ph] 21 May 2019.

It is well known that cross-sections in perturbative QCD receive large corrections from soft and
collinear radiation, whose properties must be resummed to all orders in the coupling. Whether
or not the universal properties of this radiation can be extended to next-to-leading power (NLP)
in the threshold expansion has been the subject of much recent study. In this paper, we consider
two types of NLP effects: the interplay of next-to-soft and collinear radiation in processes with
final state jets and the NLP contributions stemming from soft quarks. We derive an NLP
amplitude for soft gluons and quarks, valid for an arbitrary number of coloured or colourless
massless final state particles. We show explicitly that this framework can be used to correctly
obtain the dominant NLP effects in three different types of processes at next-to-leading order:
deep-inelastic scattering, hadroproduction via electron-positron annihilation and prompt photon
production. Our results provide an important ingredient for developing a universal resummation
formalism for NLP effects.

1 Introduction

The calculation of ever more precise results for cross-sections in perturbative Quantum Chromody-
namics (QCD) is a perennial necessity for current and forthcoming collider experiments. Results
typically proceed on two frontiers. Firstly, one must proceed to higher fixed orders in the strong
coupling a,. Secondly, one must supplement fixed order calculations with contributions which are
enhanced in certain kinematic regions. One such region is that of production of particles near
threshold. In that case, the phase space for the emission of additional radiation is squeezed, leading
to an incomplete cancellation between real and virtual singularities, and thus the appearance of
large contributions at all orders in perturbation theory. More specifically, if € is a dimensionless
kinematic ratio such that € > 0 near threshold, the corresponding differential cross-section has the
following form

2n—-1

wo) (S)X len (= =) + eat@ + oP mm eg...) (1)

n=0

The first two sets of terms originate from soft and collinear radiation (real or virtual). They make
up the leading power (LP) contributions in the threshold variable € and are localized at € = 0. The
contributions have a universal form, which allows for their all-order resummation [I}{16].

The third set of terms in Eq. make up the nezt-to-leading power (NLP) contributions to
the differential cross-section, as they are suppressed by a single power of the threshold variable.
Although subleading, the increasing precision both of LP resummation and of experimental data
makes such terms numerically relevant [[7|[18]. As at LP, the highest power of the NLP log at a
given order is referred to as leading-logarithmic (LL). One may then worry about next-to-leading
logarithmic (NLL) contributions, and so on. It may well be the case for collider processes of interest
that the LL NLP terms (or beyond) must be resummed for an adequate comparison of theory with
data. Even if not, elucidation of NLP contributions at a fixed order in a, may have a key role to play
in estimating higher order cross-sections. It can furthermore aid in the development of subtraction
schemes for the efficient numerical cancellation of infrared singularities [19}{20].

Both LP and NLP threshold contributions arise from radiation that is (next-to-)soft and/or
collinear. Next-to-soft radiation in gauge theory was first studied in the classic works of Refs. 21/22],
and more recently in Ref. [23]. Since then, a variety of approaches have been used to try to
systematically elucidate the structure of next-to-soft corrections [24}{34]. There has recently been
a revival of interest in this topic, partially motivated by more formal work on so-called nezt-to-soft
theorems of Refs. (see also Ref. [37]), which related soft physics to asymptotic symmetries in
gauge theory and gravity. This has led to a great deal of activity aiming to systematically classify
NLP contributions to cross-sections, using either diagrammatic factorisation formulas that generalise
their LP counterparts , or the framework of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) [43H49]. A
resummation of LL NLP effects in Drell-Yan production has recently been presented using the SCET
approach [50], confirming earlier expectations from Refs. [26}{30], and results using the diagrammatic
approach are in progress [51]. The various approaches have also been used to examine NLP effects
at fixed order in the coupling [I9)20V52}{54). Of particular relevance for the present study is Ref. [52],
which derived a universal form of the cross-section for the production of an arbitrary number of
colour singlet particles at NLO, up to NLP level, in either the qq or gg channel. An especially
elegant result was that the NLP cross-section could be expressed in terms of a simple kinematic
shift of the LO result. This both illustrates the phenomenological use of next-to-soft factorisation


formulas, and provides analytic information where this was previously absent (such as in di-Higgs
production).

To date, most studies of NLP effects (with the exception of the conjectural but well-motivated
resummation proposal of Refs. [26}30]) have focused on processes in which all real radiation is
manifestly (next-to) soft, such as Drell-Yan production. This is less complicated theoretically than
the completely general case of a process containing coloured final state particles at LO. In such
processes, both soft and collinear real emissions lead to threshold enhanced contributions, such that
one must carefully disentangle them in aiming to classify all NLP effects. It is then natural to ponder
what the recently developed next-to-soft formalisms are able to capture. In particular it is interesting
to find out whether the simple kinematic shift observed in Ref. remains relevant and to what
degree. Here we will significantly extend this previous result. We will study processes containing
final state massless coloured particles, in which we will indeed have to worry about collinear effects
associated with real radiation. Furthermore, we will consider the effect of different partonic channels
to the LO process, which open up for the first time at NLO. Such corrections are known to contain
NLP contributions, and we will construct a universal operator that can include them. In particular,
we will be able to derive an NLP amplitude for the emission of soft (anti-)quarks, up to NLO in
perturbation theory.

As a case study, we will use three examples of processes with final state jets: deep-inelastic
scattering, quark-antiquark pair production in electron-positron annihilation, and the production
of a photon in association with a hard coloured particle (prompt photon production). There are a
number of motivations for our investigation. Firstly, elucidating the structure of NLP effects is a
crucial prerequisite to being able to resum them, and it is important in particular to work out what
does and does not contribute to the LL NLP terms, which would be resummed first. Secondly, the
great interest in next-to-soft theorems has yet to be supplemented with a systematic investigation
of subleading collinear behaviour (although Ref. is a notable exception), and we hope that our
results provide a useful springboard for further work.

This paper is structured as follows. In section 2] we derive an explicit expression for the NLO
amplitude of a coloured final state in quark-antiquark, gluon-gluon or quark-gluon scattering, valid
up to NLP level in the soft expansion. This NLP amplitude can be subdivided into two separate
contributions: a gluonic contribution (section and a quark contribution (section 2.2). As
in Ref. [52], the amplitudes we obtain are fully general, and the results thus provide universal
corrections to any Born process with massless coloured particles in the final state. We then illustrate
how to apply our formalism in a number of examples of increasing complexity. In section [3] we
consider deep-inelastic scattering, whose Born amplitude contains a single final-state parton, and
in section |4| we examine hadroproduction in electron-positron annihilation, where two final state
partons are present at LO. In section [5] we look at prompt photon production, which adds the
complication of a final state which is not fully inclusive. In all cases, we find that leading logarithmic
effects up to NLP order are completely captured by performing a similar kinematic shift to that
observed for colour singlet production processes [52], in addition to inclusion of soft quark radiation.
Finally, in section [6] we discuss the implications of our results before concluding.

2 Universal NLO amplitudes for (next-to-)soft radiation

As stated above, Ref. examined dressing the amplitude for production of N massive colour
singlet particles with an additional gluon, and derived a universal form for the NLO cross-section


for any such process, valid up to next-to-soft order in the momentum of the emitted radiation.
For the emission of gluons, we will recover the results of Refs. where overlap exists,
and the derivation presented here will allow us to set up careful notation needed for what follows.
A significant extension of previous results, however, is a universal next-to-soft amplitude for the
emission of soft quarks, which we present here for the first time. The latter effect is known to be
absent at LP in the threshold expansion, but must be included at NLP level and beyond.

As is well-known, whenever a massless external line of an amplitude gets dressed with a tree level
vertex, there is a potential for an infrared (IR) divergence, with associated threshold logarithms in
the final cross-section. This potential divergence originates from two different momentum limits,
which may overlap: the emission carrying momentum k can become either soft and/or collinear to its
emitter. Whether or not and in what form the divergence will develop depends upon the kinematics
of the leading-order process. For the production of massive colour singlet particles considered in
Ref. [52], the only IR divergences that appear are manifestly associated with (next-to-)soft radiation.
When final state massless particles are present, however, one must also worry about (hard-)collinear
effects, even at LP in the threshold expansion. In this section, we restrict ourselves to (next-to-)soft
effects only, where our aim is to generalise the universal NLP amplitude formula of Ref. [52]. We
will return to the issue of hard collinear contributions when looking at specific processes in the
sections that follow.

2.1 Radiation of (next-to-)soft gluons

Let us first consider the emission of (next-to-)soft gluons. We will do this for a generic Born level
process with 2 initial state coloured particles and n final state coloured particles (see Fig. [La). As
mentioned above, this extends the work of Ref. for colour-singlet production, itself based on
the earlier work of Refs. [41[42] (see also Refs. [38}40)(441[56]). All particles are considered massless,
which will be the case for all processes considered throughout the paper BI We must then consider
all possible ways in which a gluon can be emitted, namely the contributions of Fig. where
momenta and colour indices are defined as shown. The first of these contributions, Fig. yields
the matrix element

where {ti} are elements of the colour generator in the fundamental representation, and M,, is the
hard scattering matrix element carrying colour label c; for the incoming quark. The notation is
such that M,, contains all colour generators, spinors and/or polarisation vectors, except for the
ones stemming from the line that is emitting. We have also introduced the generator of Lorentz
transformations for fermionic fields: ;

‘We note in passing that our formalism would also apply for massive coloured particles.

emitting. Since the gluon carries away momentum k and changes the colour of the quark line, this
matrix element will depend on pi = p; — k and carries a colour label cj. (c) Feynman diagram

In the second line of Eq. (2), the first two terms in the bracket come from rewriting the Dirac
propagator in a suitable form. The derivative term stems from Taylor expanding the hard scattering
matrix element M_,,(p1—k) to first order in k, where we have assumed this to be Taylor expandable.
This assumption will fail at higher loop orders due to the presence of virtual collinear singularities,
as first studied by Ref. [23], and further developed by subsequent works [38}42}|44][56)]. However,
the assumption is valid for tree- and loop-induced Born processes that are free of virtual collinear
effects, which applies to all examples studied in this paper. Carrying out a similar exercise for the
case where the initial state is an anti-quark, we find

We thus observe that for all species of incoming parton, the next-to-soft matrix element with an
additional gluon emission from the incoming leg consists of three terms: a universal scalar term
(which is proportional to 2p? — k”), a term that is sensitive to the spin of the emitter (which is
proportional to either S or W/) and a universal derivative term acting on the nonradiative amplitude.

We may carry out a similar analysis for hard emitting particles in the final state. However, the
fact that the gluon is emitted after the hard scattering results in a sign difference for the derivative
term. More specifically, in considering the emission of a gluon of momentum & from a final state
hard particle of momentum p; + k leads to a momentum-shifted amplitude

As for an initial state emitter, the NLP amplitude for a final state emitter also consists of a universal
scalar term, a term that is sensitive to the spin of the emitter and a universal derivative term.

So far, we have considered only emissions from the external legs of the non-radiative amplitude.
We must also consider the emission of a gluon from inside the hard interaction, as shown in Fig.
To this end, we may consider the Ward identity for the emitted gluon, which takes the form

straightforwardly verified that the scalar and spin contributions vanish automatically upon contract-

does not act on the asymptotic states of the hard scattering matrix element My. Combining this
expression with the other contributions above, we can now write down a general formula for the

k-C =0. Such contributions, however, can be ruled out based on gauge invariance and locality (see e.g. Refs. [5'7/[58|
for a recent discussion).


generator in the appropriate representation. We use the symbol ® in the same way as before, with
the extension that now also the spin generator should be interpreted with the appropriate coupling
of the spinor and/or vector indices to the hard interaction. We define each of these actions carefully,
for all possible types of external leg, in appendix [A] Note that the scalar contribution commences
at leading power (LP) in the soft expansion, whereas both of the angular momentum contributions
are NLP only.

In Eq. (14), the hard scattering matrix element contains only those momenta that are also present
at LO. These do not obey momentum conservation once the extra radiation is present, and there
appears to be an ambiguity in how one shares the momentum of the additional radiation between
these existing momenta (see e.g. ref. for a particularly complete discussion of this point). We
will see in Sections that actually there is no such ambiguity, as the form of the momentum
shift created by the angular momentum operators of Eq. (14) is completely fixed. Furthermore,
exact momentum conservation is enforced by integrating over the complete phase space, which is
not included in the amplitude itself.

The result of Eq. has previously been derived in a more formal context [36], where it is known
as the nezt-to-soft theorem. It was motivated by a similar result in gravity |35][37], that generalises
the leading soft results of Ref. [59]. Our reason for carefully rederiving this result here is twofold.
Firstly, we may contrast this derivation with a similar analysis for the emission of soft quarks, to be
carried out in the following section. Secondly, in applying Eq. to example scattering processes
in the remainder of the paper, it is useful to have a precise record of how to keep track of colour and
spinor/vector indices. The above derivation (and the results of appendix[A) are particularly useful in
this regard. Before moving on, note that the next-to-soft formalism of Eq. (14) applies for arbitrary
tree-level induced processes with external momenta in the non-radiative amplitude held fixed. As
such, we are certainly entitled to apply it to the processes considered in this paper, but must bear in
mind that divergent threshold contributions which are not associated with (next-to)-soft behaviour
may not be correctly described. We will see this explicitly in what follows.

2.2 Radiation of soft quarks

Having reviewed the universal NLO amplitude for the emission of a (next-to-)soft gluon, we now
turn to the emission of one additional soft quark. One must then consider all possible partonic
splittings that can lead to such an emission, which we show for the case of emission from the initial
state in Fig. Let us first consider an initial state gluon splitting into a quark-antiquark pair,
where the antiquark participates in the hard interaction (Fig. Ba). The resulting matrix element is

quark

we see that the spinor for the emitted quark scales with soft momentum as O(k!/?). Thus, the
leading power of divergence for k7 — 0 in the matrix element is O (au?) (as opposed to O(k7')

for the soft gluon case). It will therefore not give rise to a leading power threshold contribution,
but will instead contribute at NLP accuracy. Furthermore, as the leading contribution from soft
quark emission is already O(k~'/?), there will be no additional contribution from the O(k) terms
in the hard scattering matrix element or the Dirac propagator. The matrix element for soft quark

The analysis for a final state particle emitting soft quarks is similar, as is the case of antiquark
emission. Thus, we do not explicitly report the intermediate steps here. In the previous analysis
of gluon emission, we needed to consider the possibility that a gluon was emitted from inside the
hard scattering process, i.e. Fig. There is no such possibility here, which follows from the fact
that the soft quark emission is by itself already a subleading effect in the momentum expansion,
and also that any internal line is by definition far off-shell. Emission of an internal soft quark is
then sub-sub-leading in the momentum expansion, thus irrelevant at NLP order.

As for the gluon case, we can write a compact universal formula for soft quark emission. In order
to do this, we introduce a quark emission operator Q;, which acts on a given external parton line
i to produce the emission of a quark or antiquark. The action of this operator on every species of

This is very different to the next-to-soft gluon formalism of Eq. (14), in that there is no equivalent
of the scalar and orbital angular momentum contributions. The quark emission operator generates
a single “external emission” from the non-radiative amplitude, that commences at NLP order in the
momentum expansion. Unlike the gluon case, it must change the identity of the parton that enters
the hard scattering process.

In this and the previous section, we have reviewed the derivation of a universal next-to-soft
amplitude for the emission of a single additional gluon from a general Born process, up to next-to-
soft order in its momentum. We have also derived a similar result for the emission of soft (anti-)
quarks, which involved introducing the quark emission operator of Fig. We will now illustrate
how to use these expressions in a series of example scattering processes, of increasing complication.

3 NLP contributions in DIS at NLO

In this section, we will consider arguably the simplest process that has an unobserved parton in the
final state, namely deep inelastic scattering (DIS):

e (k) + q(p) > e (k’) + q(ke).

We can then use the formulae derived in section [2.1] and [2.2] to compute the NLO cross-section, up
to next-to-soft order in the momentum of the emitted radiation. For the calculation we will utilise
dimensional regularisation in d = 4 — 2¢ dimensions, and use yp to indicate the renormalisation
scale. The strong coupling is denoted as usual by as = as(u”) = g?/(47). As is customary (see e.g.
Refs. [60||61]), the complete squared amplitude before summing/averaging over spins, polarisations
and colours can be written as

where H'” (L#”) is the hadronic (leptonic) tensor respectively. To calculate the proton structure
functions, it is sufficient to consider the hadronic tensor only. Thus, we may assume an initial state
consisting of a quark and a spacelike off-shell photon, as shown in Fig. [4] Let us now consider the
NLO cross-section up to NLP order, which we calculate using Eq. (14). For the hadronic tensor, we
need the squared amplitude with different space-time indices for the off-shell photon, which reads

where we have included only those terms in the squared amplitude that are up to NLP order in
the next-to-soft expansion. By explicit calculation (similar to those performed in Ref. [52]), we find
that the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. is given by

wavefunctions removed, which we have allowed at present to be fully general. The scalar-spin

Here we have ignored terms linear in ky, as they will ultimately vanish upon integration over the
final state phase space. The latter two terms can be combined with the scalar-spin contribution
in Eq. (23), after which they also vanish. Putting everything together, the complete NLP squared
amplitude can be written in terms of the LO hadronic tensor

This is directly analogous to the case of colour singlet production examined in Ref. [52], which also
found that the squared amplitude for the one real emission contribution could be written in terms
of the momentum-shifted non-radiative amplitude. The forms of the shifts found here differ only in
that the shift in kg has an opposite sign, owing to the fact that it is a final-, rather than initial-state
momentum. Up to now we have allowed the LO stripped amplitude to be fully general, but we now
use the explicit result for DIS:

Note that there is an overall factor of 2~4-*)/? = x*, which when expanded about « = 1 contributes

Comparison of Eqs. and shows that the next-to-soft expansion misses a LP term, and a
constant at NLP order:

F} nuo(#, Q) — Fi tpynip(®, Q”) = = ( +6+O0(1 — »)) (39)
The first term on the right-hand side forms a plus distribution when combined with virtual cor-
rections. As is well-known, LP contributions in DIS correspond to the emitted gluon being either
soft and/or collinear with the final state parton kg, as shown in Fig. [5] However, we see explicitly
that the corrections to the next-to-soft approximation (i.e. collinear effects which are next-to-next-
to-soft level and beyond) do not contribute to the leading logarithms at LP or NLP order in the
threshold expansion. Thus, to capture NLP effects at LL order, we find that it is sufficient to
employ the momentum shift of Eq. GI). For the LL term, one may also approximate the phase
space in Eq. (85), ignoring the factor x*. We therefore find that the LL contributions at LP and
NLP order arise solely from the next-to-soft matrix element, combined with a LP-like phase space.
This is similar to the conclusions of Ref. [52].

It is in fact possible to describe in more detail the discrepancy of Eq. (89). Using our framework
of soft quark emission, there is a way of obtaining the missing LP NLL contribution. If we let the
quark emission operator Q; act on the outgoing quark, we generate the diagram shown in Fig.
whose contribution reads

FI, = ( : +O(1=2)). (40)

1-2

14


This shows that the LP NLL effects that do not arise from the next-to-soft gluon formalism can
in this case be correctly obtained using the soft-quark formalism. The missing LP NLL term
corresponds to the situation where the gluon becomes hard-collinear to the final state unobserved
quark, in which case the quark is allowed to get soft. It is known at LP that this hard-collinear
gluon information can also be captured by including jet functions B], but here we explicitly see
that this contribution is exactly generated by the soft quark emission operator. Our soft quark
framework also allows us to include the other partonic DIS channel in a natural way, namely the
one where the hard scattering is induced by a gluon that splits into a quark-anti-quark pair, shown
for convenience in Fig. This contribution turns out to be

Fi,== (-2+2ma-2)+0a-2). (41)

One observes the presence of a collinear pole associated with the quark-anti-quark pair. This in
turn generates an NLP logarithmic term in the finite part, due to the interplay of the collinear pole
with the factor (1 — x)~* in the 2-body phase space of Eq. (85).

The constant in Eq. is generated by the diagram shown in Fig. [bc] where all final state
partons carry a hard momentum. It therefore cannot be obtained in our soft-quark and gluon
formalism. This momentum configuration contributes as a constant and reads

F.= = (6 +O(1— z)). (42)

This is a non-leading NLP contribution, that is not captured by the soft expansion. It stems from
squaring the contribution of the emission of a gluon from an initial state line, which makes it a
neat-to-collinear effect. The study of such contributions for arbitrary processes and at higher orders
in perturbation theory deserves further investigation (although see Ref. for a discussion in a
more formal context).

In this section, we have examined a first process with a final state parton (DIS), and found
the next-to-soft formalism as derived in section can be used to derive a similar result to that
obtained for colour singlet particle production in Ref. [52]. That is, the NLO amplitude up to LP
+ NLP LL order in the next-to-soft expansion can be written in terms of the LO amplitude with
shifted external momenta (Eq. (@1)). Contrary to Ref. [52], in the present case, the next-to-soft
gluon amplitude only leads to LP and NLP LL accuracy in the final result. However, the missing
LP NLL information can actually be captured by the soft quark amplitude. This is because the
missing LP NLL information actually originates from a momentum configuration where the quark
and gluon are collinear to one another. The soft quark amplitude contains this missing collinear
information exactly at NLO. To investigate how general this situation is, it is instructive to consider
a second inclusive process with two final state jets, which we do in the following section.

The next process we will consider is that of hadroproduction in electron-positron annihilation:

where we will choose q(k1) to fragment into the observed hadron, and be inclusive for the other final

We have introduced the invariants

°We could also consider the longitudinal fragmentation function. However, as for the longitudinal structure
function F', in DIS, this does not contain logarithmic contributions at NLO.

satisfying s = s1 + 82 + 819. Using momentum conservation and the on-shell conditions for the
anti-quark and the gluon, we can parameterise the phase space in a convenient way using

$2512 — 818

As in the case of DIS, we may now calculate the one real emission correction to the y* > q+ X
amplitude up to NLP order, by applying the next-to-soft formalism of Eq. (I4). This proceeds
directly analogously to the previous calculation, and we find that the squared amplitude may be
written as

Thus, as in the DIS and colour singlet production cases [52], we again find that all NLP effects can
be written in terms of the momentum-shifted non-radiative amplitude. The momentum shifts are
similar in form to the previous cases, but both have a negative sign in Eq. and Eq. owing
to the fact that both hard partons are now in the final state. Putting together all of the above
ingredients, the next-to-soft result for the parton fragmentation function F7ip+nip(Z, Q?) is

Similar to the DIS case, the next-to-soft formalism predicts the LL behaviour, but fails to capture
a LP term and a constant piece at NLP order:

Again, the soft quark formalism allows us to generate the missing LP NLL contribution by using
the Q;-operator on the LO matrix element, generating the diagram in Fig. Its contribution
reads

gz 1
Ft = Th (-+ +2+0(1- ) , (54)

which exactly corresponds to the needed LP NLL term, as in the DIS case. Since the quark carrying
momentum k; is observed and therefore non-soft, the other contribution Fp,» (shown in Fig.
cannot be obtained using our soft-quark or next-to-soft-gluon formalism. This contribution will
however contribute at NLP NLL and beyond. It reads

Fry = 2 (2400-2), (55)
, Ar €

where we have also shown some O(1 — z) terms, given that the latter contribution itself includes a

pole in ¢. This can be traced back to the singularity associated with & being hard and collinear with

the parton of 4-momentum k ,, which is observed. As in the DIS case, we thus note the presence of

an NLP term of collinear origin, and therefore a next-to-collinear contribution.

In this section we have examined a second example with a final state parton that is unobserved.
We again find that we can successfully use Eq. (14) to obtain an NLO result for the amplitude
that is accurate up to NLP order in the next-to-soft expansion. Similar as to the previous case,
we find that the result is accurate only to LL. Surprisingly, we find in both the DIS case and the
present case that the missing NLL LP information is fully accounted for by adding the soft quark
contribution.

5 NLP cross-section for NLO prompt photon production

In this section we will consider the production of a single photon that recoils against a hard parton
at NLO, where the latter is unobserved. This process has more partonic sub-channels than the ones

18

previously considered and it has more than one colour structure to consider at NLO. This makes
the prompt photon production process an interesting testing ground for our next-to-soft gluon and
soft quark formalisms.

At leading order, the prompt photon production process (pp > y + X) consists of two subpro-
cesses: qq > yg and qg > q7y, as shown in Fig. [7]

At next-to-leading order in the coupling, one additional particle can be radiated. This creates
a variety of new diagrams that one has to consider. Firstly, one can add an additional gluon to the
two Born processes: qq > ygg and qg — qgy. The presence of this additional gluon will create
the leading power logarithmic contributions to the NLO cross-section. Apart from that, there will
be diagrams that appear for the first time at NLO and contain an extra quark in the final state:
qq —> yg, gg — yaqq and qq? > yqq). Although only the two Born processes need to be
considered for a leading power analysis, all of the other additional subprocesses will also contribute
at NLP only due to the possibility of either a quark or gluon becoming soft and/or collinear.

Due to the presence of different subprocesses, we have divided this section into three subsections.
In subsection we will consider the channel that only has gluons in the final state: qq > gqgy.
Then, in subsection [5.2] we instead consider the quark radiative cross-section (qq + qqgy), which
does not contribute at LP and only commences at NLP order. In the last subsection, we will consider
the most involved example, namely one where both gluons and quarks are present in the final state.
We will find there that the next-to-soft gluon effects are factorised from the soft quark effects,
therefore their contributions can be calculated separately, as was suggested in section For our
calculations we will use wr to indicate the factorisation scale and the electromagnetic finestructure
constant is given by a = gfy,/(47).

5.1 qd — ggy channel

We first consider the process obtained by dressing qq > gy with one additional gluon, where the
relevant Feynman diagrams for this are shown in Fig. Given that gluons are the only partons
in the final state, it should be sufficient to describe this process, up to next-to-soft level, with the
amplitude of Eq. (4). To compute the cross-section, we must calculate the squared amplitude,
summed and averaged over final/initial state colours and spins. This involves summing over all
polarisations for the emitted gluon, and one may restrict this to be over physical degrees of freedom
by defining an arbitrary lightlike vector / such that /-e(k) = 0, where €,,(k) is the polarisation vector
of the gluon, thus obtaining

la kg + 1g ka
Ye h(k)ea(k) = — Mag + ATES. (56)

phys.

19


Alternatively, one may sum over all polarisations (including an unphysical longitudinal degree of
freedom), provided one introduces external ghost particles to remove the spurious contributions.
As argued in Ref. [52], however, soft ghosts do not contribute up to NLP order in the momentum
expansion, and thus one may replace Eq. with []

So eh (kea(k) = —Nag- (57)

pols.

Since the current process is more involved than the DIS and ete~ cases due to the presence of more
than two NLO diagrams, we will again provide explicit details of how to construct the next-to-soft
squared amplitude, thus illustrating the use of Eq. in a more complicated scenario. As before,
we will start with the scalar amplitude

where the matrices Mere» Mie and Mees correspond to the shaded circles in the first three
diagrams in Fig. [8] whose dependence on the momenta pj, p2, pr and p, is implicitly understood.
For clarity we have included explicit colour labels on the matrix element, indicating that it still
depends on the colour structure via the SU(3) generators. The double scalar contribution to the
matrix element squared, inclusive of spin/colour averaging factors, is easily computed and results
in

process q(p1)¢(p2) + g(pr)y(py) stripped of its polarisation vectors, spinors, colour factors and
charges, and where we suppress the momenta labels for brevity.

We now move on to the scalar-spin interference term. The spin amplitude for the qq > ggy process

Here we see explicitly the presence of two different colour structures, namely terms in the square
bracket which are proportional to Cr and C', respectively. For the Cr contribution, the derivative
term is accompanied by additional contributions, involving the shifts Ops.4 and Op 9: A similar
situation occurred in Eq. for the DIS process, where the additional contributions ended up
being cancelled by the spin-scalar interference term. The same turns out to happen here if one
introduces a Sudakov decomposition for k, defined here such that

where kp(;,;) is defined to be orthogonal to both p; and p;. As in the DIS and ete” case, terms that
are proportional to ky will ultimately vanish upon integration over the final state phase space, so we
will ignore them in what follows. Interestingly, for the C4 term there is no need for a cancellation
originating from a spin-scalar contribution, as the terms proportional to C’, vanish directly up to
O(kr). Putting all pieces together, the complete LP + NLP squared amplitude can then be written
as

momenta p; and pz are shifted by dp. and dpo.1 respectively. This result is directly analogous to the
previous cases, which also found that the squared amplitude for the one real emission contribution
could be written in terms of the momentum-shifted non-radiative amplitude. There is a notable
difference with respect to our previous results, however. Both the DIS and ete~ cases had only

two parton legs in the Born interaction, and the final result for the squared amplitude consisted

22


of a dipole-like eikonal factor dressing the momentum shifted hard interaction (Eqs. (31) and (48)
respectively). In the present case, we see multiple dipole-like terms, each consisting “ an eikonal
factor involving two hard momenta p; and p; dressing a hard interaction where the same momenta
are shifted. Furthermore, different dipole terms have correspondingly different colour structures. As
remarked above, the momentum shifts in Eq. (67) are generated by a combination of the spin and
orbital term for the Cpr colour structure and only by the orbital term for the C’, colour structure.
The orbital terms act as a momentum shift operator on the hard scattering of the matrix element,
while the spin term takes care of the same shift on the asymptotic states.

We are now in a position to integrate over the final state momenta pr and k and compute the
differential cross-section. We will separate the three-body phase space into two two-body phase
spaces, one containing the unobserved partons, the other describing the photon and the collective
effect of the unobserved partons. To this end, we first factor the three-body phase space as

1
diby = 5— f AP? dbo(rr + paipy,P) Ab2(Piprh), (68)

where the second two-body phase space factor on the right-hand side is in the center of mass frame
of the two unobserved partons, and takes the form

1 2
d®2(P;pr,k) = (“SE) Tet PGs) (Gs) mrarecs | do, (sin 0,)' aan d62 (sin 02) ~ (69)

after having parameterised the momenta as follows:

fn = —, (1,0,...,0,sin 0; sin 62, sin 6; cos 02, cos 6; )
JP?
k= —,— (1,0,...,0, — sin 6; sin 92, — sin 01 cos 2, — cos 61).

In terms of the invariants s = (pj + po)”, wi = (pi — py)”, ti = (po — py)? and 84 = (pi + p2— py)? =
(k + pr)’, the other phase space is given by

Ars? 1
do(pi + pe; Py,P) = (=) SraP =e) =a" — 84 ) far, fan (70)

To compare our results with the NLO calculation presented in Ref. [63], we will make a change of
variables:

ul = —svw
ty = s(v-1)
sg = st+ti+u, =sv(l—w), (71)

where (1 — w) plays the role of the threshold variable € in Eq. (i.e. w — 1 at threshold). In
terms of these invariants the complete three body phase space now reads

_ (Anew? ie v (v°(1— v)w(1— w)) ~ (1 — v)w( 1—2e —2e
d®3 = s( ; ) ——“Gmra 22) T— de) wD [ow faw [ dé; (sin 0;) [ d62 (sin 02) ~“ .(72)

23



Furthermore, we will extract a common factor of vw(1—v)s from the differential cross-section as

was done in Ref. [63], and we obtain

collected for convenience up to NLP order in the threshold expansion in appendix |C} Upon doing
so we observe that, as before, the next-to-soft formalism correctly reproduces LL terms at both
LP and NLP orders. Subleading terms would again require the addition of hard (next-to-)collinear
information, but it is reassuring that LL information is correctly reproduced even in a less inclusive
situation. Similary to the DIS and eTe™ cases, the missing hard-collinear information is encoded in
the jet functions. Here however, the missing information cannot be accounted for by the soft quark
formalism as there are no quarks in the final state. One might wonder why here it is not enough
to add the possibility that the other gluon carrying momentum pp becomes soft, while in the case
where the jet function was initiated by a fragmenting quark this was indeed enough. In the latter
case, the fragmenting quark (Fig. dresses the non-radiative amplitude according to

(Au?) Tr (KM!) + 0). (75)

(pi - k)

Here, the k — 0 limit does not contribute at LP order, as then the soft singularity will vanish.
This is related to the fact that the quark propagator is suppressed by one power of soft momentum.
However, the p; > 0 limit does contribute, and constitutes exactly the missing collinear information,
which can be added by the soft quark formalism.
The fragmenting gluon case of Fig. [Tel yields

where we see the appearance of three separate contributions: k > 0, p; > 0 and k- p; > 0 with
neither being soft. The latter case is, by definition, not captured by the next-to-soft formalism, and
contributes a LP NLL term that is then a truly hard-collinear effect. By explicit calculation this
contribution reads

which is indeed the missing LP NLL term. The second contribution that is missing is one that
originates from a final state gluon — into a quark-antiquark pair. This results in a Taye
contribution, which the authors of Ref. added to the qq > ggy subprocess. Formally it is part
of the qq > ya¢g and qg > yq'7 subprocesses, therefore we will treat this contribution in the next
section.

The above cross-section contains infrared poles, that must be absorbed into the parton distribu-
tions via the usual mass factorisation procedure. This leads to a novel source of NLP contributions
in the fully subtracted cross-section, which is worth drawing attention to. Mass factorisation can be
performed by adding a counter cross section, which is a convolution of a scaled Born cross section
with the parton distribution functions. The phase space for the counter term consists of a two-body
final state, and is given by

db, = (=) ——— / dv [ews dwé(1— (78)

There is then a difference in the ¢-dependence with respect to the three-body phase space of Eq.
(72), such that subtracting the counterterm leads schematically to an NLP contribution in the finite
part of the cross-section:

1 Anp?\* (v*(L—v)w(L—w)) ~*~ — (4mu?\* (vd = v))*

__ (= — “)) 2 In (77/8) In(v) In(w) . (79)
+ (

l—w (—w)+ (-w)y (—w)s

The first and second term on the second line of this equation are part of the LP LL and NLL
contribution, whereas the fourth term is of NLP order. The third term on the second line gives
subleading logarithmic contributions at both LP and NLP orders. To see this, note that in the
prompt photon production process the observable is pr, and the threshold limit is given by Ap? > s
[64]. The Mellin moment is then taken with respect to x7. = 4p7,/s and reads [64]

The LP contributions are therefore fixed at v = 1/2, with O(1/N) terms appearing for v 4 1/2,
which in particular affect the LL NLP contribution. Thus, it is no longer true in the final result for

where

the (subtracted) cross-section that all LL NLP behaviour can be predicted simply by classifying the
structure of the squared amplitude: there are leading logarithmic terms originating from phase space
effects in the mass factorisation procedure. This could be a crucial ingredient in future numerical
studies of NLP effects.

In this section we calculated the NLP contribution of the qq — ygg channel to the exclusive
prompt photon production process. Similar to the DIS and ete~ processes, the next-to-soft gluon
formalism indeed correctly reproduces the LL terms at both the LP and NLP order. We again
miss a hard-collinear contribution, which in this case cannot be accounted for by considering a soft
quark contribution, as there are no soft quarks in the final state. Here we explicitly need to add a
hard-collinear gluon contribution to the next-to-soft gluon formalism to include the missing LP NLL
information. We also saw that when carrying out mass factorisation for the full cross-section, one
also has to carefully keep track of additional LL NLP contributions, which is perhaps not surprising.
Having understood this particular partonic process, let us now consider a second sub-channel in the
following section.

5.2 qq — qqy channel

We now turn to the partonic sub-process of Fig.[9] whose final state contains only quarks in addition
to the photon. To compute the NLP differential cross-section, we therefore only need to consider
Eq. (19). There are 5 types of contributions, indicated in Fig. [9] which can be split into three
categories: initial state splitting (J), final state splitting (F’) and final state fragmentation (FF).
The contributions can be obtained by letting the quark emission operator Q; act on the tree level
processes qg > qy, 9g > Gy, Gq > gy and gg — qq. From the processes thus obtained, we then

26


select only those with the specific partonic assignment qq > qqy. We obtain

By separating them, we can explicitly identify the jet contribution Upp rr, which contributes at LP
NLL order. As we have already seen in the DIS and e*e~ cases, also here it is actually the collinear
information carried by the soft quark that creates the LP term. Furthermore, there are two types of
soft-collinear contributions (“7,7 and Up) whose NLP log can easily be guessed from the collinear
pole. There is also, however, an interference term that contributes at NLP level and does not come
with a collinear pole: 7,7. This term can be regarded as arising from the wide angle emission of
a soft quark. The contributions where a soft quark emission from an observed final state parton
interferes with a similar emission from an unobserved parton vanish at O(1) and will therefore only
contribute beyond NLP LL order.
Putting everything together, the NLP differential cross-section for this subprocess is

This result is remarkable, in that it demonstrates that the quark emission operator that we have
introduced in section 2.2] can be used to correctly obtain the NLP contribution to the NLO cross-
section. Since the emission of a quark is already at NLP order due to the momentum information
that is carried by the spinor, we do not need the momentum shift of the LO matrix elements.

5.3 ag qgy

This is the only subprocess for NLO prompt photon production that contains NLP contributions
due to both quark and gluon emission. Let us first consider the radiation of a gluon, where the
diagrams that we need are shown in Fig. The derivation of the (next-to-)soft gluon contribution
is directly analogous to the qq > ggy (next-to-)soft gluon amplitude analysed previously, and hence

where Tyg = v(1+ (1—v)?).

Next, we need the soft quark radiative contribution, and there are three 2 > 2 hard scattering
diagrams on which we can use the quark emission operator Q; to turn it into the process gg — qg7.
These processes are gg > qy, qq > gy and qg — qg. As in section [5.2] we will only select the

29


resulting Feynman diagrams that describe the gg + qgy sub-process. The generated NLP Feynman
diagrams are given in Fig. and the soft quark amplitude then consists of three pieces:

In section [5.1] we discussed the need to potentially include external ghost contributions when
summing over all gluon polarisations in the final state. In that previous case, these contributions
were absent at NLP. Here they will contribute owing to the presence of two hard gluons, as the
quark is already soft and in order to observe the photon it needs to recoil against at least one other
hard particle in the final state. The complete quark NLP cross-section then turns out to be:

This agrees with the full NLO calculation truncated to NLP order, as presented here in appendix[C]
Our result shows that we can separately treat the (next-to-)soft gluon and fermion radiation, as is
implied by our general analysis in section 2] Note also in this case that we do not have to add an
additional hard collinear piece to obtain all LP NLL effects. They are fully generated by taking the
effect of a soft quark emission into account.

We have here presented three of a total of seven different partonic sub-channels for prompt
photon production at NLO. The remaining channels work analogously to the ones already presented,
and are listed in appendix [B] We also present results for the unsubtracted NLO cross-sections (up
to NLP order) in appendix[C] given that these have not previously been presented in the literature.

6 Discussion

In this paper, we have examined the role of next-to-soft effects in processes containing one or more
coloured particles in the final state. A complication of such processes is that hard collinear real
radiation produces terms that are enhanced near threshold, making recently derived next-to-soft
theorems potentially incomplete. It is then necessary to examine what the domain of applicability of
such theorems is, or, in other words, to which logarithmic order these theorems are valid. Another
complication is the presence of soft quarks.

We have examined DIS, hadroproduction in electron-positron annihilation and prompt photon
production, and find a number of interesting results. More specifically, the NLO cross-section up to
next-to-soft order in the emitted gluon momentum can be expressed in terms of the non-radiative
amplitude with shifted momenta for all cases. This is directly analogous to a similar conclusion
reached for colour singlet production in Ref. [52]. Due to the presence of unobserved quarks in the
final state for all considered processes, we need to complement the next-to-soft gluon amplitude
with a soft quark amplitude. This can be treated completely independently from the next-to-soft
gluon amplitude, and itself factorises in terms of a universal quark emission operator, that we have
defined. Adding this soft (and potentially wide-angle) quark contribution to the next-to-soft gluon

3l


amplitude shows that we are able to capture all LL NLP behaviour, and also fill in missing LP NLL
information. This is due to the fact that the soft expansion is systematically building up the effects
of collinear quark emission, where the latter contributes at LP NLL and beyond. Corrections to
the next-to-soft formalism (starting at NLL) arise from collinear emissions that are next-to-next-to
soft and beyond. These corrections can include an NLP component, suggesting that a systematic
study of next-to-collinear effects would be useful (see Ref. for work in a more formal context).

When both the emitting and the emitted particles are gluons, one needs to include the known
gluon jet functions of e.g. Ref. [3] to capture the missing LP NLL hard-collinear information. That
the LL contributions are correctly captured by the next-to-soft formalism is not surprising: naively,
one expects that the leading singular behaviour should come from where all emitted radiation is
maximally soft and/or collinear. However, that this is true even for next-to-soft emissions is itself
a non-trivial result. Furthermore, it is a highly useful piece of information for considering the
resummation of NLP effects, given that one would start by proving that LL contributions can be
resummed. At fixed order, we have also clarified that leading logarithmic terms at (N)LP order
may arise from the mass factorisation procedure, which would need to be kept track of in potential
numerical studies.

Note added

In the final stages of preparing this paper, Ref. appeared, which addresses the emission of soft
and collinear radiation (including quarks) up to next-to-leading power, within the framework of soft
collinear effective theory.

A Useful definitions

In this appendix, we collect useful formulae relating to the action of various operators appearing in
Eqs. (14] (19), as well as Fig. B] First, in Eq. (I4), repeated here for convenience

we must consider a general colour generator T; acting on an external parton line j. This leads to
a colour factor dressing the nonradiative amplitude

Tyj=% —f icy for an outgoing quark or incoming anti-quark with colour label c;;
if©’ for an external gluon with colour label a,

where {ti} are components of a generator in the fundamental representation. Next, we collect
results for the numerator of the scalar contribution appearing in Eq. (14). This can be written as

OO aal gi = (2pF + nk°), (94)

where 7 = +1 (-1) for a hard emitting particle in the final (initial) state respectively. The spin
contribution in Eq. can be written in the generic form

O2inj = Lika DI”. (95)

Here, Die is a Lorentz generator in the appropriate representation of parton j, and given in specific
cases by

Jo ) Mere for an incoming gluon carrying Lorentz index p;

Meer — for an outgoing gluon carrying Lorentz index yp,

where the relevant generators are defined in Eqs. and (6). The third term in Eq. (4) can be
written as

contains the quark emission operator Q;, whose action on all possible species of incoming/outgoing
parton legs is depicted in Fig. [3] In terms of the amplitude, we may think of this operator as acting
on the wavefunction for leg 7, as follows:

Qj (w(P))) = then eulPapy v1)

There are a couple of further subtleties regarding how to apply this operator in practice. Firstly,
in cases where p; is an initial state particle, or is explicitly observed in the final state (i.e. in
an observable that is defined in a way that is not fully inclusive), one must only include those
contributions arising from the Q; operator such that the (observed) parton appearing in the LO
process has the hard momentum. Secondly, in the final line of Fig. [8] one includes the possibility
that either the quark or antiquark is soft. If neither of the decay products of the gluon are explicitly
observed, but instead summed over inclusively, then one double counts the quark/antiquark emission
contribution due to the integration over all possible momenta k. This double counting must then be
corrected for by a factor of 1/2. Thirdly, the polarisation vector may also belong to a photon. In this
case, the coupling that appears in Eq. should be modified to gzy and the generator becomes
Q,. We see an explicit example of these subtleties in the prompt photon analysis of section [5]

B_ Results for the remaining channels

Here we report the results of the prompt photon channels that are not discussed in section [5] All
of the remaining channels only have quarks in the final state, hence only the soft quark formalism
is needed to derive these results. The general form of the obtained NLP cross-section is
