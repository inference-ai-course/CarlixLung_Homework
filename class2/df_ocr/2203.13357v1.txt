Abstract

NLP research is impeded by a lack of re-
sources and awareness of the challenges pre-
sented by underrepresented languages and di-
alects. Focusing on the languages spoken in In-
donesia, the second most linguistically diverse
and the fourth most populous nation of the
world, we provide an overview of the current
state of NLP research for Indonesia’s 700+ lan-
guages. We highlight challenges in Indonesian
NLP and how these affect the performance of
current NLP systems. Finally, we provide gen-
eral recommendations to help develop NLP
technology not only for languages of Indone-
sia but also other underrepresented languages.

1 Introduction

Research in natural language processing (NLP) has
traditionally focused on developing models for En-
glish and a small set of other languages with large
amounts of data (see Figure 1, bottom right). While
the lack of data is generally cited as the key rea-
son for the lack of progress in NLP for underrep-
resented languages (Hu et al., 2020; Joshi et al.,
2020), we argue that another factor relates to the
diversity and the lack of understanding of the lin-
guistic characteristics of such languages. Through
the lens of the languages spoken in Indonesia, the
world’s second-most linguistically diverse country,
we seek to illustrate the challenges in applying NLP
technology to such a diverse pool of languages.
Indonesia is the 4th most populous nation glob-
ally, with 273 million people spread over 17,508
islands. There are more than 700 languages spo-
ken in Indonesia, equal to 10% of the world’s lan-
guages, second only to Papua New Guinea (Eber-
hard et al., 2021). However, most of these lan-
guages are not well documented in the literature;
many are not formally taught, and no established
standard exists across speakers (Novitasari et al.,

2020). Many of them are decreasing in use, as
Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia), the national lan-
guage, is more frequently used as the primary lan-
guage across the country. This process may ulti-
mately result in a monolingual society (Cohn and
Ravindranath, 2014).

Among more than 700 Indonesian local lan-
guages, many are threatened. 440 languages are
listed as endangered and 12 as extinct according to
data from Ethnologue (Eberhard et al., 2021) illus-
trated in Figure 2. Anindyatri and Mufidah (2020)
found nearly half of a sample of 98 Indonesian
local languages to be endangered while van Esch
et al. (2022) observed 71 among 151 Indonesian
local languages to have less than 100k speakers.

top-10 most spoken local languages in Indonesia (Eber-
hard et al., 2021).

Table 1 lists the names of the 10 most spoken lo-
cal languages in Indonesia (Eberhard et al., 2021).
Javanese and Sundanese are at the top with 84M
and 34M speakers, respectively, while Madura, Mi-
nangkabau, and Buginese each have around 6M
speakers. Despite their large speaker populations,
these local languages are poorly represented in the
NLP literature. Compared to Indonesian, the num-
ber of research papers mentioning these languages
has barely increased over the past 20 years (Figure
1, top). Furthermore, compared to their European
counterparts, Indonesian languages are drastically
understudied (Figure 1, bottom). This is true even
for Indonesian, which has nearly 200M speakers.

Language technology should be accessible to
everyone in their native languages (European Lan-
guage Resources Association, 2019), including In-
donesians. In the context of Indonesia, language
technology research offers some benefits. First, lan-
guage technology is a potential peacemaker tools
in a multi-ethnic country, helping Indonesians un-
derstand each other better and avoid the ethnic con-
flicts of the past (Bertrand, 2004). On a larger scale,
language technology promotes language use (Euro-

pean Language Resources Association, 2019) and
helps language preservation. Despite these benefits,
following Bird (2020), we recommend a careful as-
sessment of individual usage scenarios of language
technology, so they are implemented for the good
of the local population.

For language technology to be useful in the In-
donesian context, it additionally has to account for
the dialects of local languages. Language dialects
in Indonesia are influenced by the geographical lo-
cation and regional culture of their speakers (Van-
der Klok, 2015) and thus often differ substantially
in morphology and vocabulary, posing challenges
for NLP systems. In this paper, we provide an
overview of the current state of NLP for Indone-
sian and Indonesia’s hundreds of languages. We
then discuss the challenges presented by those lan-
guages and demonstrate how they affect state-of-
the-art systems in NLP. We finally provide recom-
mendations for developing better NLP technology
not only for the languages in Indonesia but also for
other underrepresented languages.

2 Background and Related Work

2.1 History and Taxonomy

Indonesia is one of the richest countries globally
in terms of linguistic diversity. More than 400 of
its languages belong to the Austronesian language
family, while the others are Papuan languages spo-
ken in the eastern part of the country. As shown
in Figure 3, the Austronesian languages in Indone-
sia belong to three main groups: Western-Malayo-
Polynesian (WMP), Central-Malayo-Polynesian
(CMP), and South-Halmahera-West-New-Guinea
(SHWNG) (Blust, 1980). WMP languages are
Malay, Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese,
and Minangkabau, among others. All languages
mentioned in Table | are in this group. Lan-

guages belonging to CMP are languages of the
Lesser Sunda Islands from East Sumbawa (with
Bimanese) onwards to the east, and languages
of the central and southern Moluccas (including
the Aru Islands and the Sula Archipelago). The
SHWNG group consists of languages of Halma-
hera and Cenderawasih Bay, and further-flung re-
gions such as the Mamberamo River and the Raja
Ampat Islands. Meanwhile, the Papuan languages
are mainly spoken in Papua, such as Dani, Asmat,
Maybrat, and Sentani. Some Papuan languages
are also spoken in Halmahera, Timor, and the Alor
Archipelago (Palmer, 2018; Ross, 2005).

Most Austronesian linguists and archaeologists
agree that the original ‘homeland’ of Austronesian
languages must be sought in Taiwan and, prior to
Taiwan, in coastal South China (Adelaar, 2005;
Bellwood et al., 2011). In the second millennium
CE, the Austronesian people moved from Taiwan to
the Philippines. From the Philippines, they moved
southward to Borneo and Sulawesi. From Bor-
neo, they migrated to Sumatra, the Malay Penin-
sula, Java, and even to Madagascar. From Su-
lawesi, they moved southward to the CMP area
and eastward to the SHWNG area. From there,
they migrated to Oceania and Polynesia, as far as
New Zealand, Easter Island, and Hawaii (Gray and
Jordan, 2000). The people that lived in insular
Southeast Asia, such as in the Philippines and In-
donesia, before the arrival of Austronesians were
Australo-Melanesians (Bellwood, 1997). Gradual
assimilation with Austronesians occurred, although
some pre-Austronesian groups still survive, such
as Melanesian people in eastern Indonesia (Ross,
2005; Coupe and Kratochvil, 2020).

At the time of the arrival of the first Europeans,
Malay had become the major language (lingua

franca) of interethnic communication in Southeast
Asia and beyond (Steinhauer, 2005; Coupe and
Kratochvil, 2020). It functioned as the language of
trade and the language of Islam because Muslim
merchants from India and the Middle East were the
first to introduce the religion into the harbor towns
of Indonesia. After the arrival of Europeans, Malay
was used by the Portuguese and Dutch to spread
Catholicism and Protestantism. When the Dutch ex-
tended their rule over areas outside Java in the nine-
teenth century, the importance of Malay increased,
and thus, the first standardization of the spelling
and grammar occurred in 1901, based on Classical
Malay (Abas, 1987; Sneddon, 2003). In 1928, the
Second National Youth Congress participants pro-
claimed Malay (henceforth called Indonesian) as
the unifying language of Indonesia. During World
War II, the Japanese occupying forces forbade all
use of Dutch in favor of Indonesian, which from
then onward effectively became the new national
language. From independence until the present,
Indonesian has functioned as the primary language
in education, mass media, and government activi-
ties. Many local language speakers are increasingly
using Indonesian with their children because they
believe it will aid them to attain a better education
and career (Klamer, 2018).

2.2. Efforts in Multilingual Research

Recently, pretrained multilingual language models
such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), mBART (Liu
et al., 2020), and mT5 (Xue et al., 2021b) have
been proposed. Their coverage, however, focuses
on high-resource languages. Only mBERT and
mT5 include Indonesian local languages, i.e., Ja-
vanese, Sundanese, and Minangkabau, but with
comparatively little pretraining data.

Some multilingual datasets for question answer-
ing (TyDiQA; Clark et al., 2020), common sense
reasoning (XCOPA; Ponti et al., 2020), abstrac-
tive summarization (Hasan et al., 2021), passage
ranking (nMARCO; Bonifacio et al., 2021), cross-
lingual visual question answering (xGQA; Pfeif-
fer et al., 2021), language and vision reason-
ing (MaRVL; Liu et al., 2021), paraphrasing (Para-
Cotta; Aji et al., 2021), dialogue systems (XPer-
sona & BiToD; Lin et al., 2021a,b), lexical normal-
ization (MultiLexNorm; van der Goot et al., 2021),
and machine translation (FLORES-101; Guzman
et al., 2019) include Indonesian but most others
do not, and very few include Indonesian local lan-


guages. An exception is the weakly supervised
named entity recognition dataset, WikiAnn (Pan
et al., 2017), which covers several Indonesian local
languages, namely Acehnese, Javanese, Minangk-
abau, and Sundanese.

Parallel corpora including Indonesian local lan-
guages are: (i) CommonCrawl; (ii) Wikipedia
parallel corpora like MediaWiki Translations;!
and WikiMatrix (Schwenk et al., 2021) (iii) the
Leipzig corpora (Goldhahn et al., 2012), which in-
clude Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, Minangk-
abau, Madurese, Acehnese, Buginese, Banyjar,
and Balinese; and (iv) JW-300 (Agié and Vulié,
2019), which includes dozens of Indonesian lo-
cal languages, e.g., Batak language groups, Ja-
vanese, Dayak language groups, and several lan-
guages in Nusa Tenggara. Recent studies, how-
ever, have raised concerns regarding the quality
of such multilingual corpora for underrepresented
languages (Caswell et al., 2022).

2.3. Progress in Indonesian NLP

NLP research on Indonesian has occurred across
multiple topics, such as POS tagging (Wicaksono
and Purwarianti, 2010; Dinakaramani et al., 2014),
NER (Budi et al., 2005; Rachman et al., 2017;
Gunawan et al., 2018), sentiment analysis (Narad-
hipa and Purwarianti, 2011; Lunando and Purwari-
anti, 2013; Wicaksono et al., 2014), hate speech
detection (Alfina et al., 2017; Sutejo and Lestari,
2018), topic classification (Winata and Khodra,
2015; Kusumaningrum et al., 2016), question an-
swering (Mahendra et al., 2008; Fikri and Purwari-
anti, 2012), machine translation (Yulianti et al.,
2011; Simon and Purwarianti, 2013; Hermanto
et al., 2015), keyphrases extraction (Saputra et al.,
2018; Trisna and Nurwidyantoro, 2020), morpho-
logical analysis (Pisceldo et al., 2008), and speech
recognition (Lestari et al., 2006; Baskoro and Adri-
ani, 2008; Zahra et al., 2009). However, many
of these studies either did not release the data or
used non-standardized resources with a lack of doc-
umentation and open source code, making them
extremely difficult to reproduce.

Recently, Wilie et al. (2020), Koto et al. (2020b,
2021), and Cahyawijaya et al. (2021) collected In-
donesian NLP resources as benchmark data. Others
have also begun to create standardized labeled data
for Indonesian NLP, e.g. the works of Kurniawan
and Aji (2018), Guntara et al. (2020), Koto et al.

‘https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Content_translation

(2020a), Khairunnisa et al. (2020), and Mahendra
et al. (2021).

On the other hand, there has been very little
work on local languages. Several works studied
stemming (Sundanese (Suryani et al., 2018); Bali-
nese (Subali and Fatichah, 2019)) and POS Tag-
ging (Madurese; Dewi et al., 2020). Koto and
Koto (2020) built a Indonesian Minangkabau paral-
lel corpus and also sentiment analysis resources
for Minangkabau. Other works developed ma-
chine translation systems between Indonesian and
local languages, e.g., Sundanese (Suryani et al.,
2015), Buginese (Apriani et al., 2016), Dayak
Kanayatn (Hasbiansyah et al., 2016), and Sambas
Malay (Ningtyas et al., 2018).

Tanaya and Adriani (2016, 2018) studied Ja-
vanese character segmentation in non-Latin script.
Safitri et al. (2016) worked on spoken data lan-
guage identification in Minangkabau, Sundanese,
and Javanese, while Azizah et al. (2020) devel-
oped end-to-end neural text-to-speech models for
Indonesian, Sundanese, and Javanese. Nasution
et al. (2017, 2021) proposed an approach for bilin-
gual lexicon induction and evaluated the approach
on seven languages, i.e., Indonesian, Malay, Mi-
nangkabau, Palembang Malay, Banjar, Javanese,
and Sundanese.

Cahyawijaya et al. (2021) established a machine
translation benchmark in Sundanese and Javanese
using Bible data. Wibowo et al. (2021) studied
a family of colloquial Indonesian, which is influ-
enced by some local languages via morphologi-
cal transformation, and Putri et al. (2021) worked
on abusive language and hate speech detection on
Twitter for five local languages, namely Javanese,
Sundanese, Madurese, Minangkabau, and Musi.

3 Challenges for Indonesian NLP

3.1 Limited Resources

Monolingual Data Unlabeled corpora are cru-
cial for building large language models, such as
GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) or BERT (Devlin
et al., 2019). Available unlabeled corpora such
as Indo4B (Wilie et al., 2020), and Indo4B-Plus
(Cahyawijaya et al., 2021) mainly include data in
Indonesian, with the latter containing ~10% of
data in Javanese and Sundanese.

In comparison, in multilingual corpora such as
CC-—100 (Conneau et al., 2020), Javanese and Sun-
danese data accounts for only 0.001% and 0.002%
of the corpus size respectively while in mC4 (Xue

# speakers (Million)

Figure 4: Relationship between the number of speakers
and the size of data in Wikipedia for languages spoken
in Europe, Asia, and Indonesia.

et al., 2021b), there are only 0.6M Javanese and
0.3M Sundanese tokens out of a total of 6.3T to-
kens. In addition, we measure data availability in
Wikipedia compared to the number of speakers in
Figure 4.7 Much less data is available for the lan-
guages spoken in Indonesia, compared to European
languages with similar numbers of speakers. For
example, Wikipedia contains more than 3 GB of
Italian articles but less than 50 MB of Javanese ar-
ticles, despite both languages having a comparable
number of speakers. Similarly, Sundanese has less
than 25 MB of articles, whereas languages with
comparable numbers of speakers have more than
1.5 GB of articles. Similar trends hold for most
other Asian languages. Languages in Africa are
even more underrepresented in terms of Wikipedia
data (see Appendix B).

Beyond the highly spoken local languages, most
other Indonesian local languages do not have
Wikipedia instances, in contrast to European lan-
guages with few speakers. It is very difficult to find
alternative sources for high-quality text data for
other local languages of Indonesia (such as news
websites), as most such sources are written in In-
donesian. Resources in long-tail languages are even
more scarce due to a very low number of speakers.
Moreover, most of the languages in the long tail are
mainly used in a spoken context, making text data
challenging to obtain. These statistics demonstrate

?The number of speakers is collected from Wiki-
data (Vrande¢ié and Krotzsch, 2014), from the number of
speakers (P1098) property as of Nov 7th, 2021, while
the size is collected from the 20211101 Wikipedia dump.

that collecting unlabeled corpora for Indonesian
local languages is extremely difficult. This makes
it impractical to develop strong pretrained language
models for these languages, which have been the
foundation for many recent NLP systems.

Labeled Data Most work on Indonesian NLP
(see §2) has not publicly released the data or mod-
els, limiting reproducibility. Although recent In-
donesian NLP benchmarks are addressing this is-
sue, they mostly focus on the Indonesian language
(see Appendix F). Some widely spoken local lan-
guages such as Javanese, Sundanese, or Minangk-
abau have extremely small labeled datasets com-
pared to Indonesian, while others have barely any.
The lack of such datasets makes NLP develop-
ment for the local languages difficult. However,
constructing new labeled datasets is still challeng-
ing due to: (1) the lack of speakers of some lan-
guages; (2) the vast continuum of dialectical vari-
ation (see §3.2.1); and (3) the absence of writing
standard in most local languages (see $3.3).

3.2 Language Diversity

The diversity of Indonesian languages is not only
reflected in the large number of local languages
but also the large number of dialects of these lan-
guages (§3.2.1). Speakers of local languages also
often mix languages in conversation, which makes
colloquial Indonesian more diverse (§3.2.2). In ad-
dition, some local languages are more commonly
used in conversational contexts, so they do not have
consistent writing forms in written media (§3.3).

3.2.1 Regional Dialects and Style Differences

Indonesian local languages often have multiple di-
alects, depending on the geographical location. Lo-
cal languages of Indonesian spoken in different
locations might be different (have some lexical
variation) to one another, despite still being catego-
rized as the same language (Fauzi and Puspitorini,
2018). For example, Anderbeck (2008) showed
that villages across the Jambi province use differ-
ent dialects of Jambi Malay. Similarly, Kartikasari
et al. (2018) showed that Javanese between differ-
ent cities in central and eastern Java could have
more than 50% lexical variation, while Purwan-
ingsih (2017) showed that Javanese in different
districts in the Lamongan has up to 13% lexical
variation. Similar studies have been conducted on
other languages, such as Balinese (Maharani and
Candra, 2018) and Sasak (Sarwadi et al., 2019).

Table 3: Lexical variations of Javanese dialects and styles across different regions of the Java island. Native

speakers are asked to translate the words, given the context.

Moreover, Indonesian and its local languages
have multiple styles, even within the same dialect.
One factor that affects style is the level of politeness
and formality—similar to Japanese and other Asian
languages (Bond and Baldwin, 2016). More polite
language is used when speaking to a person with a
higher social position, especially to elders, seniors,
and sometimes strangers. Different politeness lev-
els manifest in the use of different honorifics and
even different lexical terms.

To illustrate the distinctions between regional
dialects and styles, we highlight common words
and utterances across dialects and styles in Jambi
Malay and Javanese in Tables 2 and 3 respectively.
For Jambi Malay, we sample the result from a prior
work (Anderbeck, 2008). For Javanese, we ask
native speakers to translate basic words into three
regional dialects: Western, Central, and Eastern
Javanese, and two different styles: Ngoko (stan-
dard, daily-use Javanese) and Krama (polite Ja-
vanese, used to communicate to elders and those
with higher social status). However, since contem-
porary Krama Javanese is not very different among
regions, we only consider Krama from the Eastern
speakers’ perspective.

Jambi Malay has many dialects across villages.
As shown in Table 2, many common words are
spoken differently across dialects and styles. Simi-
larly, Javanese is also different across regions. Not
every Javanese speaker understands Krama, since
its usage is very limited. Moreover, the number of
Javanese speakers who can use Krama is declin-

from other languages are shown in Appendix D.

Case Study in Javanese

Dialectical and style differences pose a challenge
to NLP systems. To explore the extent of this chal-
lenge, we conduct an experiment to test the ro-
bustness of NLP systems to variations in Javanese
dialects. We ask native speakers‘ to translate 29
simple sentences into Javanese according to the
specified dialect and style. We then evaluate sev-
eral language identification systems on those in-
stances. Language identification is a core part of
multilingual NLP and a necessary step for collect-

3Krama is used to speak formally (e.g., with older or re-
spected people). However, people prefer to use Indonesian
more in a formal situation. People who move from sub-urban
areas to bigger cities tend to continue to use Ngoko and thus
also pass Ngoko on to their children.

“Our annotators are based in Banyumas, Jogjakarta, and
Jember for Western, Central, and Eastern Javanese respec-
tively. Using dialects from different cities might yield different
results.

ing textual data in a language. Despite its impor-
tance, it is an open research area, particularly for
underrepresented languages (Hughes et al., 2006,
Caswell et al., 2022).

We compare langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012),
FastText (Joulin et al., 2017), and CLD3.° The
results can be seen in Table 4. In general, the lan-
guage identification systems are more accurate in
detecting Javanese texts in the Ngoko-Central di-
alect, or Krama, since the systems were trained on
Javanese Wikipedia data, which is written in either
the Ngoko-Central or Krama dialects and styles.
If an NLP system can only detect certain dialects,
then this information should be conveyed explic-
itly. Problems arise if we assume that the model
works equally well across dialects. For example,
in the case of language identification, if we use
the model to collect datasets automatically, then Ja-
vanese datasets with poor-performing dialects will
be underrepresented in the data.

3.2.2 Code-Mixing

Code-mixing is an occurrence where a person
speaks alternately in two or more languages in a
conversation (Sitaram et al., 2019, Winata et al.,
2018, 2019b, Dogru6éz et al., 2021). This phe-
nomenon is common in Indonesian conversa-
tions (Barik et al., 2019, Johanes et al., 2020, Wi-
bowo et al., 2021). In a conversational context,
people sometimes mix their local languages with
standard Indonesian, resulting in colloquial Indone-
sian (Siregar et al., 2014). This colloquial-style
Indonesian is used daily in speech and conversa-
tion and is common on social media (Sutrisno and
Ariesta, 2019). Some frequently used code-mixed
words (especially on social media) are even intelli-
gible to people that do not speak the original local
languages. Interestingly, code-mixing can also oc-
cur in border areas where people are exposed to

multiple languages, therefore mixing them together.
For example, people in Jember (a regency district
in East Java) combine Javanese and Madurese in
their daily conversation (Haryono, 2012).

Indonesian code-mixing not only occurs at the
word level but also at the morpheme level (Winata,
2021). For example, quotenya (“his/her quote’, see
Table 5) combines the English word quote and the
Indonesian suffix -nya, which denotes possession;
similarly, ngetag combines the Betawinese prefix
nge- and the English word tag. More examples can
be found in Table 5.

3.3. Orthography Variation

Many Indonesian local languages are mainly used
in spoken settings and have no established stan-
dard orthography system. Some local languages do
originally have their own archaic writing systems
that derive from the Jawi alphabet or Kawi script,
and even though standard transliteration into the
Roman alphabet exists for some (e.g., Javanese and
Sundanese), they are not widely known and prac-
ticed (Soeparno, 2015). Hence, some words have
multiple romanized orthographies that are mutually
intelligible, as they are pronounced the same. Some
examples can be seen in Table 6. Such a variety
of written forms is common in local languages in
Indonesia. This variation leads to a significantly
larger vocabulary size, especially for NLP systems
that use word-based representations, and presents
a challenge to constrain the representations for dif-
ferent spellings of the same word to be similar.

3.4 Societal Challenges

Language evolves together with the speakers. A
more widely used language may have a larger digi-
tal presence, which fosters a more written form of
communication, while languages that are used only


within small communities may emphasize the spo-
ken form. Some languages are also declining, and
speakers may prefer to use Indonesian rather than
their local language. In contrast, there are isolated
residents that use the local language daily and are
less proficient in Indonesian (Nurjanah et al., 2018,
Jahang and Meirina, 2021). These variations give
rise to different requirements, and there is no single
solution for all.

Technology and education are not well-
distributed within the nation. Internet penetration
in Indonesia is 73.7% in 2020 but is mainly con-
centrated on Java. Among the non-Internet users,
39% explain that they do not understand the tech-
nology, while 15% state that they do not have a
device to access the Internet.® In some areas where
the Internet is not seen as a basic need, imposing
NLP technology on them may not necessarily be
relevant. At the same time, general NLP develop-
ment within the nation faces difficulties due to the
lack of funding, especially in universities outside
of Java. GPU servers are still scarce, even in top
universities in the country.’

The dynamics of population movement in In-
donesia also need to be taken into consideration.
For example, urban communities transmigrate to
remote areas for social purposes, such as teaching
or becoming doctors for underdeveloped villages.
Each of these situations might call for various new
NLP technologies to be developed to facilitate bet-
ter communication.

4 Opportunities

Based on the challenges for Indonesian NLP high-
lighted in the previous section, we formulate pro-
posals for improving the state of Indonesian NLP
research, as well as of other underrepresented lan-
guages. Our proposals cover several aspects includ-
ing metadata documentation; potential research di-
rections; and engagement with communities.

4.1 Better Documentation

In line with studies promoting proper data docu-
mentation for NLP research (Bender and Friedman,
2018, Rogers et al., 2021, Alyafeai et al., 2021,
McMillan-Major et al., 2022), we recommend the
following considerations.

°The Indonesian Internet Providers Association (APJID
survey: https://apjii.or.id/survei2019x

’For instance, we estimate the whole CS Faculty of the
country’s top university to have fewer than 10 GPUs.

Regional Dialect Metadata We have shown that
a local language can have large variation depend-
ing on the region and the dialect. Therefore, we
suggest adding regional dialect metadata to NLP
datasets and models, not only for Indonesian but
also for other languages. This is particularly impor-
tant for languages with large dialectical differences.
It also helps to clearly communicate NLP capabil-
ities to stakeholders and end-users as it will help
set an expectation of what dialects the systems can
handle. Additionally, regional metadata can indi-
rectly inform topics present in the data, especially
for crawled data sources.

Style and Register Metadata Similarly, we also
suggest adding style and register metadata. This
metadata can capture the politeness level of the text,
not only for Indonesian but also in other languages.
In addition, this metadata can be used to document
the formality level of the text, so it may be useful
for research on modeling style or style transfer.

4.2 Potential Research Directions

Among the most spoken local languages, a lot of
research has been done on mainstream NLP tasks
such as hate-speech detection, sentiment analysis,
entity recognition, and machine translation. Some
research has even been deployed in production by
industry. Many of the languages, however, are not
widely spoken and under-explored. Focusing on
these languages, we suggest future research direc-
tion as follows.

Data-Efficient NLP  Pretrained language mod-
els, which have taken the NLP world by storm,
require an abundance of monolingual data. How-
ever, data collection has been a long-standing
problem for low-resource languages. Therefore,
we recommend more exploration into designing
data-efficient approaches such as adaptation meth-
ods (Artetxe et al., 2020, Aji et al., 2020, Guru-
rangan et al., 2020, Koto et al., 2021, Kurniawan
et al., 2021), few-shot learning (Winata et al., 2021,
Madotto et al., 2021, Le Scao and Rush, 2021), and
learning from related languages (Khanuja et al.,
2021, Khemchandani et al., 2021). The goal of
these methods is effective resource utilization, that
is, to minimize the financial costs for computation
and data collection as advocated by Schwartz et al.
(2020), Cahyawijaya (2021), and Nityasya et al.
(2021).


Data Collection Data collection efforts need to
be commenced as soon as possible, despite all the
challenges (§3.1). Here, we suggest collecting par-
allel data between Indonesian and each of the local
languages for several reasons. First, a lot of In-
donesians are bilingual (Koto and Koto, 2020), that
is, they speak both Indonesian and their local lan-
guage, which facilitates data collection. Moreover,
the fact that the local languages have some vocab-
ulary overlap with Indonesian (see Table 7 in the
Appendix) might help facilitate building translation
systems with relatively little parallel data (Nguyen
and Chiang, 2017). Finally, having such parallel
data, we can build translation systems for synthetic
data generation. In line with this approach, the
effectiveness of models trained on synthetic trans-
lated data can be explored.

Compute-Efficient NLP The costly GPU re-
quirement for current NLP models hinders adop-
tion by local research institutions and industries.
Instead of focusing on building yet another mas-
sive model, we suggest focusing on developing
lightweight and fast neural architectures, for ex-
ample through distillation (Kim et al., 2019; Sanh
et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020), model factoriza-
tion (Winata et al., 2019a) or model pruning (Voita
et al., 2019). We also recommend research on more
efficient training mechanisms (Aji and Heafield,
2017; Diskin et al., 2021). In addition, non-neural
methods are still quite popular in Indonesia. There-
fore, further research on the trade-off between the
efficiency and quality of the models is also an in-
teresting research direction.

Robustness to Code-mixing and Non-Standard
Orthography Languages in Indonesia are prone
to variations due to code-mixing and non-standard
orthography, which occurs on the morpheme or
even grapheme level. Models that are applied to In-
donesian code-mixed data need to be able to learn
morphologically faithful representations. There-
fore, we recommend more explorations on methods
derived from subword tokenization (Gage, 1994;
Kudo, 2018) and token-free models (Gillick et al.,
2016; Tay et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2021a) to deal
with this problem. This problem is also explored
by Tan and Joty (2021) in an adversarial setting.

NLP Beyond Text For many Indonesian local
languages that are rarely if ever written, speech is
a more natural communication format. We thus
recommend more attention on less text-focused

research, such as spoken language understand-
ing (Chung et al., 2021; Serdyuk et al., 2018),
speech recognition (Besacier et al., 2014; Winata
et al., 2020a,b), and multimodality (Dai et al., 2020,
2021) in order to improve NLP for such languages.

4.3 Engagement with Communities

As discussed in §3.4, it is difficult to generalize a
solution across local languages. We thus encourage
the NLP community, such as the Indonesian Asso-
ciation of Computational Linguistics (INACL)* to
work more closely with native speakers and local
communities. Local communities who work on
linguistics such as Polyglot Indonesia,? Merajut In-
donesia,'° and Masyarakat Linguistik Indonesia!
would be relevant collaborators to provide solutions
and resources that support use cases benefiting the
native speakers and communities of underrepre-
sented languages. We advise the involvement of
linguists, for example, to aid the language docu-
mentation process (Anastasopoulos et al., 2020).
We also support open-science movements such as
BigScience!* or ICLR CoSubmitting Summer! to
help start collaborations and reduce the barrier to
entry to NLP research.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we highlight challenges in Indonesian
NLP. Indonesia is one of the most populous coun-
tries and the second-most linguistically diverse
country of the world, with over 700 local languages,
yet Indonesian NLP is underrepresented and under-
explored. Based on the observed challenges, we
also present recommendations to improve the sit-
uation, not only for Indonesian but also for other
underrepresented languages.

A Language Statistics

In Figure 5, we contrast the count of publications
related to Indonesian languages compared to Eu-
ropean languages. Although there are many more
Indonesian speakers than most European languages,
the amount of published research relating to Indone-
sian is still comparatively lower than for European
languages.

B_ Wikipedia Availability

In Figure 6, we compare Wikipedia size (in GB
file size) compared to the number of speakers for
various languages. We show that some African
and indigenous American languages are even more
under-resourced.

C_ Wikipedia Vocabulary Overlap

In Table 7, we present vocabulary statistics for
Indonesian languages based on Wikipedia. Due
to the noisy nature of Wikipedia, we use “Kamus
Besar Bahasa Indonesia’ (KBBI) third edition, '*
the official dictionary for the Indonesian language
to filter out the top 1% and top-100 most frequent
words. As expected, the top 1% words are less
reliable, with only 59.3% of vocabulary overlap
between id and KBBI. In the top-100 words, there
is a 96% word overlap with KBBI, making this set
more reliable. Previous work on Minangkabau by
Koto and Koto (2020) also showed that id-min
words have a 55% overlap in a manually curated
bilingual dictionary, closer to the top-100 value for
min in Table 7.

D Dialect Differences

In this section, we present more examples of lexical
variations in local Indonesian languages. Maharani
and Candra (2018) and Sarwadi et al. (2019) show
lexical variations in Balinese and Sasak, respec-
tively, where they asked locals to translate gen-
eral/common words. Then, they compared the vo-
cabulary across different locations (in this case,
villages) to each other. Some of the examples can
be seen in Tables 8 and 9. Unfortunately, they did
not provide quantitative results. Pamolango (2012)
conducted a similar experiment in the Banggai dis-
trict of South Sulawesi across 31 observation points
for the Saluan language. While Pamolango (2012)

did not provide full examples, they reported up to
23.5% lexical variation among 200 basic vocabu-
lary items.

E_ Local Language Classification

As shown in Table 10, some Javanese texts are
misidentified as Indonesian, English, and Malay.
This is because Javanese and Indonesian (which is
similar to Malay) share some words. We believe
English misclassification is due to the data size
bias.

F Indonesian NLP Resources

In Table 11, we present the list of existing monolin-
gual and parallel corpora in Indonesian and local
languages. Table 12 shows the list of publicly avail-
able NLP datasets for Indonesian. Table 13 shows
the list of NLP tools and resources for Indonesian.
Table 14 shows the list of publicly available NLP
datasets for local languages spoken in Indonesia.
Although the volume of data in local languages
is much smaller than that for Indonesian, these re-
source collections are arguably beneficial for con-
structing resources in other local languages. This

is because: (1) Indonesian can be used as a pivot
language with regard to local languages, due to
the large vocabulary overlap (see Table 7); and 2)
most Indonesians are bilingual, speaking both In-
donesian and their local language (Koto and Koto,
2020).
