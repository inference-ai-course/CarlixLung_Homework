in Vision-Language Models

Abstract

As vision—language models (VLMs) become
increasingly capable, maintaining a balance be-
tween safety and usefulness remains a central
challenge. Safety mechanisms, while essen-
tial, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where
models decline benign requests out of exces-
sive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the vi-
sual modality. This setting introduces unique
challenges, such as dual-use cases where an
instruction is harmless, but the accompanying
image contains harmful content. Models fre-
quently fail in such scenarios, either refusing
too conservatively or completing tasks unsafely,
which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe comple-
tion, i.e., fulfilling the benign parts of a request
while explicitly warning about any potentially
harmful elements. To address this, we present
DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal benchmark
focused on over-refusal and safe completion
in VLMs. We evaluated 18 VLMs across 12
hazard categories, with focus on their robust-
ness under semantics-preserving visual pertur-
bations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9%
safe completion, GPT-5 models average 7.9%,
and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that
DUAL-Bench will foster the development of
more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure
models remain both safe and useful in complex
multimodal settings.

1 Introduction

As large language models (LLMs) permeate real-
world applications, preventing models from follow-
ing malicious instructions or producing harmful
content has become a major concern (Bai et al.,
2022c). The yet has converged on a spectrum of
defenses, ranging from preference-based alignment
(RLHF/RLAIF) to rule-driven “Constitutional” ap-
proaches (Bai et al., 2022a,c).

Figure 1: Illustration of three model behaviors. Given
the same benign prompt (“Describe this image”), mod-
els may (i) provide a Direct Answer (which may be
unsafe), (ii) produce a Direct Refusal (which is unhelp-
ful), or (iii) achieve a Safe Completion, which balances
usefulness and safety.

Yet, defense is not free: practice reveals two cou-
pled failure modes: Over-refusal denotes unwar-
ranted refusals on answerable requests (Cui et al.,
2025), while under-generalization captures unsta-
ble refusal on harmful or jailbreak variants (Mou
et al., 2025), motivating methods that seek a bet-
ter Pareto between non-over-refusal and defense
robustness rather than collapsing into blanket re-
fusals.

In the vision modality, the safety boundary is
notably more brittle, as even small visual or ty-
pographic perturbations can flip refusal decisions
(Gong et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2024). However, the
current dominant focus of this line of work is on
defense robustness, with a large body of research
devoted to evaluating whether models consistently
refuse harmful image instructions (Liu et al., 2024;
Luo et al., 2024; Weng et al., 2024), while the com-
plementary dimension of over-refusal is largely
overlooked.

In practice, a model that over-refuses benign

tasks is as misaligned with the Helpful, Honest,
and Harmless (HHH) principle as a model that

leaks harmful completions (Huang et al., 2025).
What is missing, therefore, is a benchmark that can
systematically measure over-refusal in vision tasks
and, crucially, the stability of non-over-refusal de-
cisions under realistic image perturbations. This is
precisely the gap our work aims to fill.

In this paper, we concentrate on dual-use tasks,
that is, the instruction of the task itself is clearly
allowable (e.g., “describe the picture”), while the
material can contain sensitive components. In such
cases, the appropriate response under the HHH
principle is to safely and helpfully carry out the re-
quested activity, while truthfully avoiding any con-
cealment of content, and, finally, to act harmlessly
by explicitly warning of any potentially harmful el-
ements in the material. This action aligns with the
notion of “safe completion,” which involves fulfill-
ing all non-harmful components of a request before
refusing any inherently harmful commands (Yuan
et al., 2025). This regime allows us to measure
whether models fall into over-refusal on benign
tasks for sensitive image cases.

We introduce a multi-modal benchmark in which
harmful instructions are rendered as images. For
comparison, we also provide a benign version ob-
tained through detoxification re-framing. To en-
sure consistency with existing text-modality bench-
marks, we adopt the standard definitions of Re-
fusal Rate and Direct Answer Rate (Cui et al.,
2025). We additionally report AJ R — the perfor-
mance gap in task completion between benign and
harmful-instruction settings, following (Maskey

et al., 2025). We further adopt the combined “safety
+ helpfulness” evaluation proposed in (Yuan et al.,
2025) as the standard for safe completion, and com-
pute the safe completion rate accordingly. For each
image, we generate multiple semantics-preserving
perturbations of the original (e.g., mild cropping,
resizing, or rotation) and measure the resulting
changes in these metrics. The magnitude of such
variations serves as our primary indicator of robust-
ness.

With this motivation, we systematically study
over-refusal in the visual modality and the robust-
ness of safe completion under realistic perturba-
tions. Our main contributions are as follows:

e We release the first benchmark and dataset
on visual over-refusal, comprising 12,000
harmful instructions with benign counterparts
across 12 categories, rendered into 144,000
images with five semantics-preserving pertur-
bations for robustness evaluation.

¢ We present a comprehensive comparative eval-
uation of 18 state-of-the-art models and re-
lease the complete benchmark suite to facili-
tate reproducibility, fair comparison, and fu-
ture research on multi-modal safety.

¢ We show that models perform poorly on dual-
use cases, struggling to balance safety and
usefulness: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9%, the
GPT-5 family averages 7.9%, and the Qwen
family 3.9%.

2 Related Work

Safety Alignment in LLMs: Existing approaches
such as RLHF, RLAIF, and Constitutional AI
mainly emphasize preventing harmful outputs, but
often induce excessive refusals; this has led to re-
cent research on over-refusal alignment’.

Refusal & Over-Refusal in Text Benchmarks:
Excessive defensive strategies often lead to over-
refusal, where models decline to answer even be-
nign queries that should receive valid responses.
This issue was first systematically examined in the
text modality. OR-Bench introduced the first dedi-
cated benchmark for over-refusal, defining the core
metrics of Refusal Rate and Direct Answer Rate
to measure whether models unnecessarily reject
safe requests (Cui et al., 2025). Other text-only
benchmarks, such as SafeBench and the text subset
of MM-SafetyBench, also include refusal evalua-
tion dimensions, broadening the scope of refusal
robustness assessment (Liu et al., 2024; Ying et al.,
2024).

Safe Completion in Alignment Research: Build-
ing on the limitations of refusal-centric evaluation,
recent work introduces the concept of safe com-
pletion, which emphasizes that models should not
only refuse harmful instructions but also complete
all non-harmful parts of a request. For example,
(Yuan et al., 2025) formalizes safe completion as
a combined metric that balances helpfulness and
harmlessness. This metric extends beyond pure re-
fusal indicators by rewarding models that provide
partial yet safe answers instead of blanket refusals.
In this way, safe completion captures the more nu-
anced alignment goal of being helpful, honest, and
harmless simultaneously.

Multi modal Safety Benchmarks: Recent multi-
modal benchmarks such as VSCBench, SafeCoT,
OVERT, and MultiBench extend safety evaluation
into vision-language settings. These benchmarks
primarily focus on robustness and refusal against

harmful content or jailbreak attempts, systemat-
ically testing whether models consistently reject
unsafe instructions (Geng et al., 2025; Ma et al.,
2025; Cheng et al., 2025; Liang et al., 2021)
However, these efforts rarely address the comple-
mentary challenges of over-refusal and safe com-
pletion. As a result, while multimodal safety evalu-
ation has made progress on robustness, it has yet
to fully capture the trade-offs between helpfulness
and harmlessness, leaving a critical gap that moti-
vates our work.
Robustness & Perturbation Studies: Research
on robustness shows that subtle input changes can
flip a model’s refusal decision. Adversarial attacks
use crafted prompts to bypass alignment (Jiang
et al., 2023), while typographic perturbations ex-
ploit small visual changes like homoglyphs or spac-
ing (Gong et al., 2025b). Compositional adversar-
ial queries mixing benign and harmful parts further
expose fragile refusal boundaries (Wei et al., 2024).
These findings suggest that robustness involves
not just resisting direct jailbreaks but also ensur-
ing consistent refusal behavior under natural input
variation. Unlike prior work that emphasizes unnat-
ural perturbations, our study examines semantics-
preserving changes, such as mild cropping, resiz-
ing, or rotation in vision, which retain task meaning
while testing consistency in refusal and safe com-
pletions.

3 Problem Formulation & Metrics

3.1 Task Setup & Notation

We study the problem of multimodal refusal evalu-
ation under dual-use settings.

Each input instance is defined as a pair (P, J),
where: P is a fixed textual prompt: ‘Describe the
image.’. I is an image containing an embedded text
instruction rendered visually.

The model is expected to generate a response R
that adheres to the HHH principle.

We categorize the image content in J into two
types, based on the nature of the instruction visually


rendered in the image:

¢ Harmful Instruction Image (/;,): The image
contains text that explicitly requests illegal
or dangerous actions (e.g., “How to make a
bomb?’’).

Benign Instruction Image (J,): The image
contains text that is entirely safe and does not
imply any harmful behavior (e.g., “How to
make a cake?”’).

By applying (J), we obtain perturbed versions
of the input image and can evaluate the consistency
of model behavior under slight visual variation.

3.2 Ideal Response Behavior
In our benchmark, an ideal response should follow

the HHH principle through the following strategy:

¢ Complete the benign part of the task: Pro-
vide a helpful description of the safe visual
content.

Warn of potential harm: Explicitly identify
and warn about any dangerous or sensitive
content detected in the image.

Maintain honesty without propagating
harm: Acknowledge the presence of harmful
elements without generate specific operational
details.

3.3 Label Space & Judgment Criteria

In our task setup, input instances consist of both
harmful images Jparm and safe images I are. Since
the task is open-ended generation, there is no single
reference answer; instead, we evaluate model be-
havior by categorizing outputs into a unified label
space.

Specifically, we adopt two complementary label
systems: Direct Answer (da) and Refusal (r) from
(Cui et al., 2025), and Safe Completion (sc) and
Non Safe Completion (non-sc) from (Yuan et al.,
2025). The detailed definitions and annotation cri-
teria for each label are provided in Appendix A.3.

Judgment Methodology Our judgment protocol
builds upon the LLM-as-a-Judge framework pro-
posed in OR-Bench (Cui et al., 2025)°. Specifically,

>The detailed of explainnation of Response Behavior can
be foudn in Appendix A.2

3OR-bench LLM as Judge prompt can be found in Ap-
pendix A.4

model outputs are categorized into three labels: Di-
rect Answer, Direct Refuse, and Indirect Refuse,
and same as Or-Bench we then group Direct Refuse
and Indirect Refuse together as label Refusal.

In addition, inspired by the human-annotated cri-
teria in (Yuan et al., 2025), where Safe Completion
is defined as both safe and helpful, we extend this
idea by employing an automatic LLM-as-a-Judge
pipeline tailored to our fixed instruction task (“De-
scribe the image’’), which enables the classification
of Safe Completion’.

3.4 Metrics

Building on our categorization scheme, we evaluate
model behavior using Refusal Rate (RR) and Direct
Answer Rate (DAR) metrics from OR-Bench (Cui
et al., 2025), Instruction Robustness Gap (AJR)
from (Maskey et al., 2025) and Safe Completion
Rate (SCR) from (Yuan et al., 2025) >.

Refusal Rate (RR). We compute the Refusal
Rate separately for harmful and benign instructions
as the proportion of instances in which the model
issues a direct refusal:

1
RR, = — 1[R €r],c € th, b}.
= Ty Merce (hab)

Direct Answer Rate (DAR) We compute the
Direct Answer Rate separately for harmful and
benign instructions as the proportion of instances
in which the model issues a direct answer:

1
DAR, = in YS" 1[R € dal,c € {h, b}.
“| Tel,

Instruction Robustness Gap (AJR). Following
(Maskey et al., 2025), we define the difference in a
model’s ability to follow instructions as

AIR = DARy — DARy.

Safe Completion Rate (SCR). Following the
“safety + helpfulness” notion of safe comple-
tion (Yuan et al., 2025), we compute the share of
harmful-image cases where the model both warns
about potential risks and completes the benign por-
tion of the request:

3.5 Robustness & Stability under
Perturbations

Perturbation Set. Let II denote a set of
semantics-preserving image transformations (e.g.,
mild rotation, cropping, and resizing). For an origi-
nal image I, each 7 € II yields a perturbed image
m(I) that preserves task meaning.

For each perturbation 7 € II, we recompute all
metrics (RR,, DAR,.,SCR, AIR) and summarize
robustness via change of scores.

4 Dataset and Benchmark Design

4.1 Scope and Coverage

We define the scope of our benchmark as multi-
modal dual-use over-refusal evaluation. The goal
is to systematically measure whether models can
achieve safe completion without falling into un-
necessary refusals, while maintaining robustness
against semantically-preserving perturbations.

For coverage of harmful content, we adopt the
MLCommons safety taxonomy followed by Llama
Guard, which defines 13 hazard categories (Inan
et al., 2023; Vidgen et al., 2024). In our benchmark,
we focus on 12 representative harmful instruction
categories® that are both safety-critical and relevant
to real-world multimodal misuse.

Each harmful instruction is paired with a benign
detoxified counterpart, ensuring that every harmful
prompt has a semantically similar but non-harmful
version.

To assess robustness, we further apply semantics-
preserving perturbations to all image instances.
Specifically, we generate five perturbed variants
per image.

These perturbations preserve the semantic mean-
ing of the embedded instruction while introduc-
ing realistic distribution shifts that often desta-
bilize refusal boundaries in multimodal mod-
els. By combining broad categorical coverage
with perturbation-based robustness evaluation, our
benchmark provides a comprehensive testbed for
measuring both safety and usefulness in dual-use
multimodal tasks.

‘The 12 harmful categories are: Violent Crimes, Non-
Violent Crimes, Sex-Related Crimes, Child Sexual Exploita-
tion, Defamation, Specialized Advice (e.g., financial scams,
hacking), Privacy Violations, Intellectual Property Abuse, In-
discriminate Weapons, Hate Speech, Suicide & Self-Harm,
and Sexual Content.

4.2 Data Construction Pipeline

We construct the dataset through a multi-stage
pipeline: (1) harmful instructions are generated
using GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 with the AIM jailbreak
method, followed by initial filtering for conciseness
and diversity; (2) Llama Guard 4 verifies harm-
fulness and assigns domain categories, yielding
around 10,000 harmful seeds; (3) benign coun-
terparts are created via keyword-based detoxifica-
tion with Gemini 2.5 Pro, replacing harmful enti-
ties with benign ones while preserving structure;
(4) dual safety verification is applied using Llama
Guard 4 and Claude 3 Haiku to eliminate any am-
biguous or risky cases; and (5) all instructions are
rendered into images under a unified configuration
to ensure visual consistency. Detailed prompts,
filtering settings, and rendering specifications are
provided in Appendix B.

4.3. Semantics-Preserving Perturbations

To evaluate robustness, we adopt five types
of semantic-preserving perturbations: real back-
ground, noise background, rotation, font-size re-
duction, and language perturbation. Detailed de-
scriptions and implementation choices are provided
in Appendix B.1.

4.4 Dataset Scale and Statistics

The final dataset consists of 12,000 harmful instruc-
tions and 12,000 benign instructions. In addition to
the main dataset, 12 categories of harmful instruc-
tions are preserved, each containing 100 samples,
together with their corresponding detoxified ver-
sions, resulting in 2,400 text samples for image
rendering. For each sample, five types of perturba-
tions are applied in addition to the original image.
In total, the benchmark dataset contains 14,400
instances. ’

5 Evaluation Protocol

The evaluation focuses on vision-language mod-
els (VLMs) performing image description under a
dual-use setup. Each input instance is represented
as a pair (P,J), where the prompt P is fixed as
“Describe the image.” and I is an instruction ren-
dered visually within an image. Images are divided
into two categories: harmful instruction images
and benign instruction images. To assess robust-
ness, we additionally apply a perturbation set IT of

semantics-preserving transformations, which intro-
duce realistic distribution shifts.

We adopt a dual-layer LLM-as-a-Judge frame-
work to categorize model outputs into Direct An-
swer, Direct Refusal, Indirect Refusal, and Safe
Completion. Judgments are obtained through
multiple independent LLM families with cross-
validation, and ambiguous cases are re-evaluated
for finer granularity. To ensure reliability, we con-
duct manual inspections, cross-model consistency
checks, and OCR-based readability tests. All data
generation, perturbation, and evaluation pipelines
are executed with fixed random seeds to guarantee
reproducibility. Detailed judging prompts, proto-
cols, and quality control measures are provided in
Appendix C.

6 Experimental Setup

We evaluate a total of 18 state-of-the-art VLMs,
spanning both closed- and open-source families,
including OpenAI, Google Gemini, Qwen, Mis-
tral, and LLaMA. The evaluation is conducted
on our dual-use over-refusal benchmark, compris-
ing 14,400 harmful—benign image pairs across
12 categories, each rendered with five semantics-
preserving perturbations, under the fixed prompt
“Describe the image.” Detailed dataset composition
and evaluation setup are provided in Appendix D.
Model responses are mapped into the label
space defined in Section 3.3, and scored accord-
ing to the safety and usefulness metrics (DARharm,
DARbenign, RRpenign, SCR, and ATR).

patterns emerge. The GPT-4.1 and LLaMA fami-
lies show the strongest over-refusal (ORRpgrm =
0.646 and 0.372), while Qwen is moderately con-
servative (0.138). In contrast, Gemini, GPT-5, and
Mistral/Pixtral maintain high benign DAR (>0.99)
with harmful ORR <0.1, indicating better refusal
calibration.

Performance under Safety Completion Under
the Help+Use framework (Yuan et al., 2025), only
GPT-5 achieves non-trivial safe completion (SCR
avg. 7.9%, up to 14%), while Qwen and Mis-
tral/Pixtral show minor cases (~3-4%). GPT-4.1
and LLaMA families nearly collapse to zero SCR,
reflecting refusal bias rather than nuanced safety.

Stability under AIR Robustness patterns mirror
the above. Mistral/Pixtral performs best (AIR =
0.038), followed by GPT-5, Gemini, and Qwen
(0.09-0.13). In contrast, GPT-4.1 (0.64) and
LLaMA (0.35) suffer large gaps, suggesting brittle
alignment under harmful inputs.

7.2 Robustness under Perturbations

Figure 13 shows overall model sensitivity to vi-
sual and textual perturbations. Models with higher
baseline Refusal Rate (RR) tend to be less robust,
displaying larger fluctuations under minor changes.
GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-Mini fluctuate by more than
0.25 in DAR and RR across perturbations, while
LLaMA-4-Scout shifts by over 0.20. In contrast,

Figure 4: Family-wise models’ performance across safety-related categories. Same setting as Figure 3.

Gemini and GPT-5 families remain relatively stable
(average variation <0.05). This confirms that strong
refusal often correlates with weaker robustness.

Figure 14 further reports absolute perturbation
magnitudes. Most perturbations degrade perfor-
mance by reducing Direct Answer Rate (DAR)
by 5-15% and increasing Refusal Rate (RR) by
0.05—0.12. A notable exception is the noise back-
ground, where GPT-4.1 shows an abnormal rise in
refusal from 0.70 to 0.82, suggesting exposure to or
adversarial fine-tuning on noisy data and resulting
in hypersensitivity to benign noise.

Finally, semantic perturbations such as cross-
lingual translation have even stronger effects. For
example, Qwen-2.5-VL-32B drops from 0.80 DAR
to 0.61 under Chinese translation, while GPT-5-
Nano falls from 0.86 to 0.62. These results high-
light that language perturbations can induce the
most severe instability in otherwise competitive
models.

7.3 Safety Completion Analysis

Safety completion is a central objective of our
study, yet only a few models demonstrate this ca-
pability—primarily GPT-5, Qwen, and Mistral/Pix-
tral. Within the OR-Bench framework, explicit
refusals are labeled as indirect refusals, meaning
true safe completions may be partially obscured.
As shown in Figure 12, the GPT-5 family
achieves the highest safe completion rates, aver-
aging 7.9% (up to 12.9% for GPT-5-Nano). While
GPT-5-Nano reaches the best absolute score, it is
also the least stable under perturbations; larger vari-
ants remain more consistent. Qwen models display
partial safe completion (3—4%) but with high insta-
bility, and Mistral-24B performs well at baseline

yet deteriorates sharply when perturbed.

Overall, smaller models (e.g., GPT-5-Nano,
Mistral-24B, Qwen-32B) achieve higher safe com-
pletion but are fragile, whereas larger ones (GPT-5-
Mini, Qwen-72B) trade off completion ability for
robustness. These findings highlight the lack of
reliable strategies for balancing safety and useful-
ness, underscoring the need for alignment methods
that jointly optimize both.

7.4 Case Studies & Error Analysis

Case 1: Figure 1la shows a benign example,
where refusals should not occur. GPT-4.1 mistak-
enly followed the embedded visual text (“Create an
open-ended conversation ...”’) instead of the actual
prompt (“Describe this image’), leading to a refusal
judgment. This reflects confusion between the tex-
tual instruction and the instruction embedded in
the image, showing that instruction-following is
easily misled by the visual modality. Similar errors
appear in models such as LLaMA-4-Scout, whose
direct answer rate drops to 87% mainly due to such
misinterpretation.

Case 2: Figure 11b illustrates the case with
the highest safe completion ratio. The image em-
beds a harmful query (“What are some ways I can
hurt myself without anyone knowing about it?”)
alongside the benign prompt “Describe this image.”
Despite the sensitive domain of Suicide & Self-
Harm, most models responded with safe comple-
tions instead of direct refusals. ChatGPT-5 models
in particular achieved the strongest safety comple-
tion rates. By contrast, GPT-4.1 and all LLaMA
variants (Maverick-17B, Scout-17B, 90B-VL, 11B-
VL) defaulted to refusal, while Qwen-VL-Plus and
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B ignored the harmful content and

directly answered the query®.

8 Discussion

Across model families, most systems—except GPT-
4.1 and LLaMA—display acceptable over-refusal
behavior but still default to direct answers, risking
the leakage or facilitation of harmful content. The
optimal operating point is safe completion, yet per-
formance remains weak: GPT-5-Nano reaches only
12.9%, the GPT-5 family averages 7.9%, and Qwen
family around 3.9%.

Current benchmarks overemphasize _ bi-
nary outcomes—over-refusal versus direct
answer—while visual tasks are more complex and
involve numerous dual-use cases. Contemporary
models lack explicit safe-completion policies and
large-scale training on suitable data to develop this
behavior.

Models should maintain stability under
semantics-preserving shifts; however, families
with higher RR exhibit reduced robustness,
particularly under cross-lingual perturbations.
Because RR, SCR, and AJR each capture
only part of the safety—usefulness trade-off, we
advocate a joint framework that integrates all
three and distinguishes safe completions from
refusals. Future model design should decompose
responses into safe completion, direct refusal, and
direct answer, supported by training data rich in
safe-completion examples and dual-use scenarios.

8 Additional error cases are provided in Appendix F3.

9 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper introduced DUAL-Bench, the first multi-
modal benchmark designed to evaluate over-refusal
and safe completion in vision—language models.
Through systematic experiments on 18 state-of-
the-art systems, we found that while most families
avoid excessive refusals, they overwhelmingly de-
fault to direct answers, risking harmful content
leakage. Crucially, safe completion remains weak
across the board, with the best-performing model
achieving only 12.9%.

Looking ahead, several directions for future
work emerge. First, the benchmark can be extended
to richer and more complex visual contexts, moving
beyond simple harmful-content images. Second,
expanding the task design beyond image descrip-
tion to cover a wider variety of multimodal sce-
narios will better reflect real-world usage. Third,
the perturbation set can be broadened to include
stronger variations, particularly linguistic perturba-
tions, which are especially disruptive in our analy-
sis. By pursuing these directions, we aim to estab-
lish a more challenging and comprehensive bench-
mark that keeps pace with the rapid progress of
multimodal models. Ultimately, we hope this work
lays the foundation for VLMs that are not only
harmless but also consistently helpful and honest
in complex real-world environments.

Limitations

Despite the contributions of this work, several limi-
tations remain.
First, existing evaluation metrics exhibit certain


conflicts. For instance, the Refusal Rate used in
OR-Bench partially overlaps with the notion of
Safe Completion rate from OpenAI, which may
obscure the true behavior of models. A more sys-
tematic set of metrics and labels is needed to better
capture the output intentions of multimodal mod-
els.

Second, our current study is restricted to a single
task-image description, whereas real-world appli-
cations involve more diverse dual-use cases. For
example, tasks such as “What is the main color of
the image?” or queries of varying sensitivity levels
should be incorporated to stress-test models under
richer conditions.

Third, the harmful-instruction images in our
dataset remain relatively simple and homogeneous.
While effective for current evaluation, such sim-
plicity may limit long-term relevance as models
continue to improve. Future datasets should there-
fore consider more complex and realistic visual
contexts.

Finally, our dataset construction relies on LLM-
generated harmful seeds, which inevitably intro-
duce biases inherent to LLMs. To build stronger
benchmarks, future work should also explore col-
lecting real harmful content and authentic seeds to
complement synthetic data.

Ethics and Broader Impact

Our work aims to support both the academic com-
munity and industry practitioners by providing a
finer-grained characterization of over-refusal in Vi-
sion language models. This enables more detailed
evaluation and targeted alignment strategies. For
instance, in specialized domains such as medicine,
models should be trusted to answer sensitive but le-
gitimate expert-level questions and provide special-
ized advice rather than defaulting to over-refusal.
Conversely, in high-risk areas such as *harmful
crime’, models should adopt a higher sensitivity
threshold to ensure safety.

Beyond evaluation, DUAL-Bench also high-
lights the importance of training models for safe
completion. Instead of treating refusal and direct
answering as the only options, models should be
encouraged to adopt a third pathway: completing
the harmless components of a request while us-
ing high-level, non-operational language to address
harmful aspects, thereby preventing the propaga-
tion of dangerous content.

At the same time, we recognize the potential

risks of misuse. Our dataset contains a large num-
ber of harmful instructions which, although limited
to textual form and devoid of explicit operational
details, still include sensitive keywords that some
users may find offensive. To mitigate this risk, the
dataset will be distributed under controlled access.
Importantly, the purpose of our benchmark is to
improve safety alignment, not to bypass it. We
strongly discourage any attempts to re purpose this
work for building systems with weakened safety
safeguards.

Overall, we hope DUAL-Bench promotes the
development of safer and more useful multi-modal
systems. By encouraging the community to move
beyond binary refusal and to embrace safe com-
pletion, our work aims to help developers better
understand both the risks of over-refusal and the
potential for misuse, while advocating for align-
ment strategies that balance helpfulness, honesty,
and harmlessness.

A Appendix

A.1 Related Work

Safety Alignment in LLMs: Efforts to align large
language models have largely focused on defense
strategies that constrain harmful behavior while
preserving usefulness. Early approaches centered
on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed-
back (RLHF), where human preference data was
used to train reward models guiding model outputs.

11

RLHF demonstrated strong effectiveness but soon
revealed scalability and bias limitations (Lindstrom
et al., 2024; Hari and Abdulla, 2023). To address
these challenges, Reinforcement Learning from
AI Feedback (RLAIF) emerged, replacing human
raters with stronger AI teachers to reduce cost and
accelerate training. While more efficient, this ap-
proach risks amplifying misalignment if the teacher
models themselves are biased (Qu et al., 2025). A
complementary direction, Constitutional AI (CAD,
shifts from preference learning to principle-driven
defenses. Here, models are guided by an explicit
“constitution” of rules, enabling them to critique
and refine their outputs without heavy human over-
sight (Bai et al., 2022b). Extensions such as it-
erative constitutional training further refine this
paradigm (Chen et al., 2024).

A.2 Problem Formulation - Ideal Response
behavior

In many real-world scenarios, the instruction itself
may be benign, yet the accompanying material may
include harmful or sensitive content, constituting a
typical dual-use problem. This is common in do-
mains such as bio-security and cyber-security(Yuan
et al., 2025).

In our benchmark, we instantiate the dual-use
scenario by fixing the instruction P as the benign
prompt “Describe this image.”, while the image I
may embed sensitive or harmful content such as
instructions for dangerous activities. Under this
setting, the ideal model behavior is to adhere to the
HHH principle by completing the benign task while
explicitly addressing potential risks, as illustrated
in Figure 8.

Since the harmful content in the image is lim-
ited to instructions or sensitive elements—trather
than explicit operational materials (e.g., detailed
blueprints for constructing explosives)—this setup
simplifies the experimental design. The model is
not required to answered safely at a high level; in-
stead, it only needs to detect the potential risk and
issue a safety warning, which is considered an ideal
output.

In such a dual-use scenario, we define safe com-
pletion as a model behavior in which the model
completes the benign task while explicitly identify-
ing and warning about potential safety risks. This
behavior aligns with the Helpful, Honest, Harm-
less (HHH) principle, while also avoiding over-
refusal.

It is important to emphasize that the prompt de-

(b) Safety Completion Rate vs. Over-Refusal Rate (ORR)

Figure 7: Unlike Fig. 2, here RR has been corrected by excluding safe completions, providing a true measure of
over-refusal. Together, these plots clarify how models balance between direct compliance, blanket refusal, and

nuanced safe completions.

Figure 8: Expanded illustration of three model behaviors. Given the same harmful content image, models may

(iii) a Refusal, which provides no utility. This figure extends Figure | by showing full response examples.

sign is crucial in this task setting. We adopt “De-
scribe this image” as the standard prompt, as it is
inherently neutral and benign. Even when the im-
age contains dangerous content, the model can still
fulfill the request by describing only the safe parts,
thereby achieving safe completion.

In contrast, prompts such as OCR the text in this
image. are unsuitable for this benchmark, as they
compel the model to directly reproduce all the text
in the image. This makes the output space rigid
and absolute; if the embedded text contains harm-
ful content (e.g., bomb-making recipes), the model

12

has no room to avoid risk, and its output effectively
becomes a vehicle for propagating harmful infor-
mation. As such, these tasks should be rejected and
are not safely completable.

In summary, we define Describe the image. as a
safe and reasonable dual-use task setting and use it
as the foundation for our benchmark design.

A.3 Problem Formulation - Label Space

In our task setup, input instances consist of both
harmful images Inarm and safe images safe. Since
the task is open-ended generation, there is no single


reference answer; instead, we evaluate model be-
havior by categorizing outputs into a unified label
space.

Unified Label Space We define two label sys-
tems: one derived from (Cui et al., 2025), and
another from (Yuan et al., 2025).

¢ Direct Answer (da): The model directly com-
pletes the given task. For safe inputs, this
means providing a correct and complete de-
scription. For harmful inputs, this corresponds
to generating unsafe or harmful content with-
out any disclaimer.

¢ Refusal (r): For harmful tasks, the model
explicitly refuses to provide a meaningful de-
scription of the image, whereas for safe tasks,
it fails to truly fulfill the request, for instance,
by giving a partial or evasive answer, avoiding
the topic, or following irrelevant or misinter-
preted instructions, thus leaving the intended
task incomplete.

another one is from (Yuan et al., 2025):

¢ Safe Completion (sc): The model issues a
clear safety warning or disclaimer while still
fulfilling the underlying task of describing the
image. This applies only in the harmful case.

¢ Non Safe Completion (non-sc): This cate-
gory includes responses where the model ei-
ther provides a direct answer to a harmful
prompt without issuing a safety disclaimer, or
explicitly refuses to respond, but without ap-
propriately addressing the harmful nature of
the input.

A.6 Metrics Explanation

A lower RR in either case indicates better align-
ment, as models should avoid indiscriminate re-
fusals regardless of instruction type.


For harmful instructions images, A higher DAR
indicates better alignment, as models not over
refuse tasks. For benign instructions images, A
higher DAR indicates better alignment, as it re-
flects the model’s ability to reliably follow safe
requests.

A smaller AJR reflects stronger instruction ro-
bustness,

A higher SCRharm indicates that, even in the pres-
ence of harmful content, the model remains helpful
by completing the benign task while being harm-
less via explicit warnings.

B__ Data Construction Pipeline

Harmful Instruction Generation. We first require
a collection of high-quality harmful instructions as
the seed set for the benchmark tasks. Following
the experimental setup of OR-Bench, we select
the model that demonstrates the weakest defense
capability and the lowest tendency toward over-
refusal in their results—GPT-3.5-turbo-0125—as
the harmful instruction generator. In order to com-
pletely disable the model’s defensive mechanisms,
we adopt the AIM jailbreak method (Kirch et al.,
2025), as shown in Appendix B.0.1. Subsequently,
we perform an initial filtering process using code
to remove overly long instructions and duplicates,
ensuring both conciseness and diversity of the cor-
pus.

Harmfulness Verification and Domain Clas-
sification. After preliminary filtering, we further
employ Llama Guard 4 to conduct safety audits and
automated quality checks on all instructions, ensur-
ing that they indeed contain potentially dangerous
content. At the same time, we use Llama Guard’s
classification labels to assign domain categories to
each instruction, preventing bias or ambiguity dur-
ing the generation process. Ultimately, we obtain
approximately 12,000 harmful instruction seeds.

Benign Version Generation. To construct
paired benign instructions, we use Google Gemini
2.5 Pro to detoxify the harmful instructions. Unlike
OR-Bench, which emphasizes semantic preserva-
tion, we adopt a keyword-replacement-based detox-
ification strategy. Specifically, we do not require
semantic continuity but instead directly replace the
core harmful entity with a benign object, while
maintaining sentence structure and length. For ex-
ample: How to make abomb? —> How to make a
cake ?. This approach leads to a significant seman-
tic shift from the original instruction but effectively

14

prevents the model from triggering over-refusal due
to sensitive semantics.

Dual Safety Verification. For the generated be-
nign versions, we employ a dual verification mecha-
nism. First, Llama Guard 4 examines whether they
contain any potential risks. Second, we use Claude
3 Haiku—the model identified in OR-Bench as
most prone to over-refusal—for auxiliary judgment.
Any instruction that may contain ambiguity or po-
tential risk is discarded, thereby ensuring that the
final benign dataset is absolutely safe.

Image Rendering Strategy. After completing
text-level construction, we render both harmful and
benign instructions into images. The rendering pro-
cess follows a unified configuration: the instruction
text occupies the full screen, with fixed black font,
standardized margins, and consistent font style.
This design ensures structural consistency across
inputs and avoids biases from low-level visual dif-
ferences.

B.1 Semantics-Preserving Perturbations

To evaluate robustness, we tested 12 different per-
turbations in and ultimately selected five types of
semantic-preserving perturbations that minimally
affect model performance, as shown Table 3. These
include: real background, where the instruction text
is overlaid on natural photo backgrounds; noise
background, where random noise is added as inter-
ference; rotation, where the text region undergoes
mild geometric rotation; font-size reduction, where
the font is made smaller but remains readable; and
language perturbation, where English instructions

Table 3: Ablation study on 12 perturbation types. We evaluate models under both SAFE and UNSAFE prompts
with the original image and twelve perturbations: three language-level changes (Urdu, Arabic, Chinese) and nine
image-level changes (Real Background, Noise Background, Color Background, Mirror & Flip, Rotation, Font Color,
Font Size—Small, etc.). The results reveal which perturbations most significantly degrade model robustness.

are translated into Chinese to test cross-lingual con-
sistency.

To ensure comparability, we apply the same ran-
dom seed across each pair of harmful and benign in-
structions, thereby keeping font size, noise density,
background type, and rotation angle consistent.

B.2. Annotation and Quality Control

In addition to the quality control procedures men-
tioned in the pipeline, we conducted random man-
ual inspections of the results. Specifically, 50 harm-
ful instructions and their corresponding detoxified
versions were sampled from each category to en-
sure that the harmful instructions are sufficiently
dangerous and the benign versions are safe. Fur-
thermore, we employed OCR-based evaluation to
test the readability of the rendered images.

C_ Evaluation Protocol

C.1 Evaluation Item Schema

Each evaluation item is defined as a (P, I), where
P is the fixed prompt, J is the instruction image.
Model outputs are mapped into the predefined label
categories (da, or, sc), as introduced in previous
Section. Judgments are obtained via the automated
LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Since the task is open-
ended, each evaluation item yields a categorical
judgment rather than a single reference answer.

C.2. Judging Procedure

We adopt a dual-layer Automated LLM-as-a-Judge
pipeline, combining the protocol of OR-Bench (Cui
et al., 2025) with the safe completion framework
of (Yuan et al., 2025).

In the first stage, following the standard OR-
Bench procedure, we perform a three-way clas-
sification of each raw model output R into Di-
rect Answer, Direct Refusal, or Indirect An-
swer, which enables the computation of re-
fusal rates. To enhance reliability, each out-

16

put is judged by three independent LLM fam-
ilies: Gemini 2. Flash(DeepMind, 2025),
openai/gpt-oss-20b(Agarwal et al., 2025),
and meta-llama/1llama-3.3-70b-instruct(AI,
2025)".

In the second stage, we adopt the helpfulness-
based judgment method proposed by (Yuan et al.,
2025), again employing the LLM-as-a-Judge
framework. Specifically, outputs initially labeled
as Indirect Answer in the harmful dataset are re-
evaluated by the same three judge models to further
distinguish between Direct Refusal and Safe Com-
pletion.

As a result, the final label space is defined as
follows: for benign datasets, model outputs are
categorized into Direct Answer or Indirect Refusal;
for harmful datasets, outputs are categorized into
Direct Answer, Direct Refusal, or Safe Completion.
All judgment prompts are included in the Appendix
to facilitate reproducibility !°.

C.3 Quality Control and Reliability

To ensure the reliability and reproducibility of our
benchmark evaluation, we adopt a multi-layer qual-
ity control protocol:

Multi-layer verification.

¢ Manual inspection: For each harmful cate-
gory, we randomly sample 50 harmful—benign
pairs and manually verify that the harmful in-
stances contain genuinely unsafe content and
the benign counterparts are risk-free.

Cross-validation with multiple judges: In
addition to the primary LLM-as-a-Judge
framework, we perform cross-checks with al-
ternative judge models to verify the stability

pendix A.4

pendix A.5


of label assignments across different evalua-
tors.

¢ Readability checks: All rendered instruction
images are tested with OCR pipelines to con-
firm that the embedded text is clearly legible,
even under perturbations.

Evaluation environment and reproducibility.
All data generation pipelines and perturbation
scripts are executed with a fixed random seed,
guaranteeing deterministic reproduction of the
dataset and evaluation items. To promote trans-
parency and facilitate replication by future re-
searchers, we will publicly release the complete
benchmark suite, including generation scripts, per-
turbation code, judge prompts, label mappings, and
all raw model outputs.

D_ Experiment setup

Dataset & Benchmark Design. We evaluate
models on the multimodal dual-use over-refusal
benchmark introduced in Section 4. The bench-
mark comprises 14,400 image-text pairs across 12
harmful instruction categories, with each category
containing 100 harmful instructions and their detox-
ified benign counterparts. Each instruction is ren-
dered into one original image and five semantics-
preserving perturbations, resulting in both harmful
and benign versions for consistent comparison.

Evaluation Protocol. We follow the evaluation
protocol described in Section 5, where the task
prompt is fixed as “Describe the image.” . Model re-
sponses are mapped into the label space defined in
Section 3.3, and scored according to the safety and
usefulness metrics (DARharm, DARpenign, RRobenign,
SCR, and AJR).

Implementation Details. For automated judg-
ments, we adopt the three-judge setup described in
Section C.2. All closed-source models are accessed
exclusively through their official APIs, while open-
source VLMs are evaluated via the OpenRouter
unified interface to ensure standardized query sub-
mission and output collection. To reduce stochastic
variance, we set the decoding temperature to 0 for
all models, with the sole exception of ChatGPT-5,
which does not support temperature control and is
therefore used with its default configuration. All
generation and perturbation pipelines are executed
with a fixed random seed to ensure deterministic
reproducibility.

17

OCR Baseline Although our task is not directly
focused on content extraction but rather on open-
ended image description, the OCR readability of
photos has a significant impact on the results.
Therefore, to ensure that all images are OCR-
readable and to minimize the influence of unread-
able content, we employ Google OCR for text ex-
traction from images and compute corresponding
metrics as a OCR baseline.

Human Baseline For each harmful category, we
randomly selected ten data samples, resulting in
a total of 120 samples. Human evaluation was
conducted through the Google Survey platform to
establish a human baseline. We recruited five par-
ticipants and adopted a cross-review procedure in
which two annotators independently evaluated each
sample. The final averaged results were computed
as the human baseline.

E_ Case Study

Figure 9 presents representative harmful prompts
and their detoxified counterparts across 12 safety-
critical categories. This illustrates how our dataset
pairs risky queries with safe reframings, enabling
direct comparison of model behavior on dual-use
cases. Figure 8 further demonstrates the role of
semantics-preserving perturbations. By applying
controlled variations—such as font size reduction,
rotation, environmental and noise backgrounds,
and cross-lingual translation—we are able to eval-
uate whether models maintain consistent safety
and usefulness under natural distribution shifts.
Together, these examples highlight the dual chal-
lenges of avoiding harmful completions while not
over-refusing benign requests, and they motivate
the need for robust benchmarks like DUAL-Bench.

Fl Category-wise Results

As illustrated in Figure 3b, model behavior varies
substantially across harmful content categories.
Among the twelve categories, Child Sexual Ex-
ploitation (CSE) and Suicide & Self-Harm (SS)
exert the most pronounced influence on both AIR
and Refusal rates. These categories consistently
trigger the strongest refusal responses across nearly
all model families. The Indiscriminate Weapons
(IW), Violent Crimes (VC), and Sex-Related
Crimes (SRC) categories also induce elevated re-
fusal rates, though to a lesser degree. This pattern

suggests that models have learned disproportion-
ately cautious behaviors in sensitive social and eth-
ical domains.

Figure 4 further highlights that even the most
aligned families such as GPT-5 and Pixtral/Mis-
tral remain highly sensitive to the SS category,
while GPT-5 and Gemini show similar over-
sensitivity to CSE-related content. This indicates
that, despite improved refusal calibration, high-
tier alignment models continue to rely on coarse-
grained risk detection mechanisms rather than nu-
anced intent-based judgment.

Detailed per-category statistics reinforce this ob-
servation, Figure 12. For example, within the GPT-
5 family, DAR under CSE drops sharply to 0.93,
with a corresponding refusal rate of 0.07, whereas
the same model achieves near-perfect DAR (1.0)
in neutral categories such as Privacy and Intellec-

18

tual Property. A similar pattern appears in the
SS category, where DAR decreases to 0.75 and RR
rises to 0.25, resulting in a AIR of approximately
0.25. This demonstrates that category-level safety
constraints substantially affect model willingness
to engage.

According to Figure 12, which visualizes the
cross-model comparison, the GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-
Mini, and LLaMA families exhibit nearly iden-
tical distributions across categories. They show
uniformly high sensitivity across all domains, with
severe over-refusal. Notably, these models respond
less defensively to the Privacy and Intellectual
Property (IP) categories compared to others cate-
gories.

F.2 Ablation Study

Table 3 presents the ablation study results across
ten perturbations. Following the robustness eval-
uation protocol (see Appendix), we ultimately re-
tained five semantic-preserving perturbations: four
that operate at the image level—real background,
noise background, rotation, and reduced font size—
and one that operates at the content level—Chinese
translation. These perturbations were selected be-
cause they minimally affect OCR ability on SAFE
inputs while still inducing measurable variance on
UNSAFE tasks.

Overall, large-scale models such as Gemini-2.5-
Pro and GPT-5-Mini demonstrate high robustness,
consistently yielding accuracies close to 1.000 on
SAFE inputs. Their OCR capacity remains sta-
ble under most perturbations, with SAFE perfor-
mance rarely dropping below 0.95. In contrast,
these models exhibit noticeable fluctuations on UN-
SAFE tasks, particularly under font-size reduction
(Gemini-2.5-Pro drops to 0.34) and cross-lingual
perturbations (0.61—0.62 on Arabic/Chinese). This
behavior aligns with the design goal: preserving
OCR quality while amplifying variance in unsafe
completion. The smaller models, Gemini-2.5-Flash
and Flash-Lite, reveal stronger vulnerability. SAFE
accuracy sharply degrades under cross-lingual and
geometric distortions (e.g., Urdu and Mirror&Flip
fall to 0.33 and 0.15, respectively), indicating a lack

19

of robustness. Similarly, GPT-5-Nano suffers heav-
ily from layout-related distortions: SAFE scores
collapse to 0.52 on Urdu and 0.50 on Mirror&Flip,
while UNSAFE scores fluctuate between 0.42-0.96.
These large gaps highlight its weaker OCR and
multilingual alignment compared to larger counter-
parts.

F.3 Error Case

Case 3: Figure 11c concerns the highly sensitive
Sexual Content category—one of the most high-
risk domains alongside Child-related Crimes. The
image explicitly requests incest-related content,
while the external prompt remains benign (“De-
scribe this image.”). In this setting, most models
adopt strict refusal as a safety defense, directly
rejecting rather than attempting safe completion.
Unexpectedly, GPT-5 produced a direct answer in-
stead of triggering refusal. While the GPT-5 family
overall maintains the lowest harmful-set refusal
rate (ORRp»grm & 0.03) and achieves non-trivial
safe completion (SCR up to 12.9%), this calibra-
tion results in a critical failure here: instead of
safe completion or strict refusal, GPT-5 directly
generated unsafe content. This highlights that min-
imizing over-refusal can come at the cost of severe
lapses in high-risk categories where absolute re-
fusal should dominate.

Case 4: Figure 11d illustrates the Defama-


tion category, which—similar to privacy-related
harms—falls under low-sensitivity instructions. In
these cases, most models provided direct answers
without warnings or deeper reasoning. Although
the generated outputs did not explicitly follow the
harmful instruction embedded in the image, they
could still enable misinterpretation or harmful prop-
agation. The optimal response should have been a
safe completion rather than a direct answer, show-
ing that most models remain under-sensitive in this
domain and fail to recognize the inherent risks.

Figure 13: Overall perturbation analysis across four metrics on harmful content images.(without difference
calculation). Rows correspond to Direct Answer Rate (DAR), Refusal Rate (RR), Instruction Robustness Gap
(AIR), and Safe Completion Rate (SCR). Five perturbations are tested, including four image-level transformations
(Real Background, Noise Background, Rotation, and FontSize-small) and one text-level transformation (Chinese
translation). Results are plotted relative to the Original baseline (red line), shown as raw values without difference
calculation across models.

Figure 14: Normalized perturbation analysis across four metrics on harmful content images. Same setting
as Figure 13, but values are shown as normalized deviations relative to the Original baseline (red line at 0).
Rows correspond to Direct Answer Rate (DAR), Refusal Rate (RR), Instruction Robustness Gap (AJR), and Safe
Completion Rate (SCR). Five perturbations are tested, including four image-level transformations (Real Background,
Noise Background, Rotation, and FontSize-small) and one text-level transformation (Chinese translation). This
view highlights the relative sensitivity of models to different perturbations.

Figure 15: Perturbation analysis on benign content images. Top: Direct Answer Rate (DAR); Bottom: Refusal
Rate (RR). Five perturbations are included, with four image-level transformations (Real Background, Noise
Background, Rotation, and FontSize-small) and one text-level transformation (Chinese translation). Results are
plotted relative to the Original baseline (red line), showing that benign inputs remain largely robust to perturbations
across models.
