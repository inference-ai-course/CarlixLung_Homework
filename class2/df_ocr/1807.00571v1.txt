Abstract

Incorporating linguistic, world and common
sense knowledge into AI/NLP systems is cur-
rently an important research area, with sev-
eral open problems and challenges. At the
same time, processing and storing this knowl-
edge in lexical resources is not a straightfor-
ward task. This tutorial proposes to address
these complementary goals from two method-
ological perspectives: the use of NLP meth-
ods to help the process of constructing and en-
riching lexical resources and the use of lexi-
cal resources for improving NLP applications.
Two main types of audience can benefit from
this tutorial: those working on language re-
sources who are interested in becoming ac-
quainted with automatic NLP techniques, with
the end goal of speeding and/or easing up
the process of resource curation; and on the
other hand, researchers in NLP who would
like to benefit from the knowledge of lexical
resources to improve their systems and mod-
els. The slides of the tutorial are available at
https://bitbucket.org/luisespinosa/Ir- nlp/.

1 Description

The manual construction of lexical resources is a
prohibitively time-consuming process, and even in
the most restricted knowledge domains and less-
resourced languages, the use of language tech-
nologies to ease up this process is becoming a
standard practice. NLP techniques can be effec-
tively leveraged to reduce creation and mainte-
nance efforts. In this tutorial we will present open
problems and research challenges in these topics
concerning the interplay between lexical resources
and NLP. Additionally, we will summarize exist-
ing attempts in this direction, such as modeling
linguistic phenomena like terminology, definitions
and glosses, examples and relations, phraseologi-
cal units, or clustering techniques for senses and

topics, as well as the integration of resources of
different nature.

As far as the integration of lexical resources in
NLP applications is concerned, we will explain
some of the current challenges in Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation and Entity Linking, as key tasks in
natural language understanding which also enable
a direct integration of knowledge from lexical re-
sources. We will explain some knowledge-based
and supervised methods for these tasks which play
a decisive role in connecting lexical resources and
text data. Moreover, we will present the field
of knowledge-based representations, in particu-
lar word sense embeddings, as flexible techniques
which act as a bridge between lexical resources
and applications. Finally, we will briefly present
some recent work on the integration of this en-
coded knowledge from lexical resources into neu-
ral architectures for improving downstream NLP
applications.

2 Outline

2.1 Introduction and Motivation

Adding explicit knowledge into AI/NLP systems
is currently an important challenge due to the
gains that can be obtained in many downstream
applications. At the same time, these resources
can be further enriched and better exploited by
making use of NLP techniques. In this context,
the main motivation of this tutorial is to show
how Natural Language Processing and Lexical Re-
sources have interacted so far, and a view towards
potential scenarios in the near future.

As an introduction we first present an overview
of current lexical resources, starting from the
de facto standard lexical resource for English,
i.e., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). We provide
a concise overview of WordNet, showing what
synsets are and how the resource can be viewed


as a semantic network. We then briefly dis-
cuss some of the limitations of WordNet and dis-
cuss how these can be alleviated to some ex-
tent with the help of collaboratively-constructed
resources, such as Freebase (Bollacker et al.,
2008), Wikidata (Vrandecié, 2012) and Babel-
Net (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). As the main
building block of these resources, we show
how collaboratively-constructed projects, such as
Wikipedia! and Wiktionary”, can serve as mas-
sive multilingual sources of lexical information.
The lexical resources session is concluded by
a short introduction to the Paraphrase Database
(PPDB) (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013; Pavlick et al.,
2015) and to a domain-specific lexical resource:
SNOMED?*, which is one of the major ontologies
for the medical domain.

The tutorial is then divided in two main blocks.
First, we delve into NLP for Creation and Enrich-
ment of Lexical Resources, where we address a
range of NLP problems aimed specifically at im-
proving repositories of linguistically expressible
knowledge. Second, we cover different use cases
in which Lexical Resources for NLP have been
leveraged successfully. The last part of the tutorial
focuses on lessons learned from work in which we
tried to reconcile both worlds, as well as our own
view towards what the future holds for knowledge-
based approaches to NLP.

2.2 NLP for Lexical Resources

The application of language technologies to the
automatic construction and extension of lexical re-
sources has proven successful in that it has pro-
vided various tools for optimizing this often pro-
hibitively costly and expensive process. NLP tech-
niques provide end-to-end technologies that can
tackle all challenges in the language resource cre-
ation and maintenance pipeline. In this tutorial
we summarize existing efforts in this direction, in-
cluding the extraction from text of linguistic phe-
nomena like terminology, definitions and glosses,
examples and relations, as well as clustering tech-
niques for senses and topics.

1. Terminology extraction. Measures for
terminology extraction, the simple conven-
tional tf-idf (Sparck Jones, 1972), lexical
specificity (Lafon, 1980), and more recent

(Hulth, 2003).

Techniques
for extracting definitional text  snip-
pets from corpora (Navigli and Velardi,
2010; Boella and Di Caro, 2013;

. Automatic extraction of examples. De-

scription of example extraction techniques
and designs on this direction, e.g., the

2015; Flati et al., 2016; Shwartz et al., 2016;

eral domain resources via topic grouping

. Alignment of lexical resources*. Align-

ment of heterogeneous lexical resources
contributing to the creation of large re-
sources containing different sources of
knowledge. We will present approaches
for the construction of such resources,
such as Yago (Suchanek et al., 2007),
UBY (Gurevychetal., 2012), BabelNet
(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) or Con-
ceptNet (Speer etal., 2017), as well as
other works attempting to improve the

sources (Matuschek and Gurevych, 2013;
Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014).

8. Ontology enrichment. Enriching lexical on-
tologies with novel concepts or with addi-
tional relations (Jurgens and Pilehvar, 2016).

2.3 Lexical Resources for NLP

In addition to the (semi)automatic efforts for eas-
ing the task of constructing and enriching lexi-
cal resources presented in the previous section,
we present NLP tasks in which lexical resources
have shown an important contribution. Effec-
tively leveraging linguistically expressible cues
with their associated knowledge remains a difficult
task. Knowledge may be extracted from roughly
three types of resource (Hovy et al., 2013): un-
structured, e.g. text corpora; semistructured,
such as encyclopedic collaborative repositories
like Wikipedia, or structured, which include lex-
icographic resources like WordNet. In this sec-
tion we present some of the applications on which
different kinds of lexical resource (including their
combination) play an important role.

We begin this section by explaining some
of the problems and challenges in Word Sense
Disambiguation and Entity Linking, as key
tasks in natural language understanding which
enable the direct integration of knowledge from
lexical resources. We describe the most relevant
knowledge-based WSD systems, both based on
definitions (Lesk, 1986; Banerjee and Pedersen,
2003; Basile etal., 2014) and  graph-based
(Agirre et al., 2014; Moro et al., 2014); and super-
vised, both linear models (Zhong and Ng, 2010;
Iacobacci et al., 2016) and the most recent branch
exploiting neural networks (Melamud et al., 2016;
Raganato et al., 2017b). We present an analysis of
the main advantages and limitations of each kind
of approach (Raganato et al., 2017a).

Then, we summarize the field of knowledge-
based representations, in particular sense vectors
and embeddings, as flexible techniques con-
necting lexical resources and downstream
applications. We first present techniques which
leverage WordNet as main source of knowledge
(Chen et al., 2014; Rothe and Schiitze, 2015;
Jauhar et al., 2015; Johansson and Pina, 2015;
Pilehvar and Collier, 2016) and also present other
techniques exploiting multilingual resources such
as Wikipedia or BabelNet (Iacobacci et al., 2015;

Camacho-Collados et al., 2016; Mancini et al.,
2017).

Finally, we briefly present a few successful
approaches integrating knowledge-based repre-
sentations into downstream tasks such as senti-
ment analysis (Flekova and Gurevych, 2016), lex-
ical substitution (Cocos et al., 2017) or visual ob-
ject discovery (Young et al., 2017). As a case
study, we present an analysis on the integra-
tion of knowledge-based embeddings into neu-
ral architectures via WSD for text classification
(Pilehvar et al., 2017), discussing its potential and
current open challenges.

2.4 Open problems and challenges

In this last section we introduce some of the open
problems and challenges for automatizing the re-
source creation and enrichment process as well as
for the integration of knowledge from lexical re-
sources into NLP applications.
