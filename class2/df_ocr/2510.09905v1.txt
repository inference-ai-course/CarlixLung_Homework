Abstract

When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is
a single mother working two jobs, does it in-
terpret her stress differently than if she were a
wealthy executive? As personalized AI systems
increasingly incorporate long-term user mem-
ory, understanding how this memory shapes
emotional reasoning is critical. We investi-
gate how user memory affects emotional in-
telligence in large language models (LLMs)
by evaluating 15 models on human validated
emotional intelligence tests. We find that iden-
tical scenarios paired with different user pro-
files produce systematically divergent emo-
tional interpretations. Across validated user-
independent emotional scenarios and diverse
user profiles, systematic biases emerged in sev-
eral high-performing LLMs where advantaged
profiles received more accurate emotional in-
terpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic fac-
tors in emotion understanding and supportive
recommendations tasks, indicating that person-
alization mechanisms can embed social hierar-
chies into models’ emotional reasoning. These
results highlight a key challenge for memory-
enhanced AI: systems designed for personaliza-
tion may inadvertently reinforce social inequal-
ities.

1 Introduction and Related Work

Large language models (LLMs) now incorpo-
rate sophisticated long-term memory that persists
across conversations (Fountas et al., 2024; Zhong
et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), while demonstrat-
ing remarkable emotional capabilities that can sur-
pass human performance on standardized tests by
over 40% (Schlegel et al., 2025). These systems
promise to remember our preferences, understand
our context, and respond with finely-tuned emo-
tional intelligence (Li et al., 2023).

Yet this convergence of personalization and emo-
tional intelligence may harbor an insidious prob-
lem: the potential for social bias to become en-
coded in AI’s emotional reasoning. Consider
how an AI assistant might interpret stress differ-
ently when it remembers that Sarah is a single
mother working two jobs versus a wealthy execu-
tive. While researchers have studied how to person-
alize LLMs for user preferences and tasks (Ning
et al., 2024; Doddapaneni et al., 2024), we lack
critical understanding of how this personalization
affects emotional reasoning across diverse user pop-
ulations.

This knowledge gap becomes particularly con-
cerning in high-stakes domains like mental health-
care and educational technology, where biased emo-
tional responses could amplify existing socioeco-
nomic disparities and compromise service qual-
ity for marginalized populations (Weissburg et al.,
2025; Schnepper et al., 2025). Drawing on Bour-
dieu’s theory of social capital (Bourdieu, 1985),
we can understand how user information creates
a personalization trap: social position across eco-
nomic, cultural, and social dimensions shapes how
others interpret our actions and emotions. When
AI systems incorporate user background informa-
tion, they risk replicating these societal biases (Shin
et al., 2024; Hida et al., 2024), potentially process-
ing identical emotional situations differently based
on who the user appears to be.

We address three research questions:

¢ (RQ1) Does adding user profiles to system
memory influence LLMs’ emotional under-
standing abilities?

(RQ2) How do different identities (gender,
age, race, ethnicity) shape LLMs’ emotional
understanding, and what biases emerge?
(RQ3) How do biases in LLMs’ emotional
understanding translate into their emotion-
related recommendations and guidance?

Our evaluation of 15 models on validated emo-
tional intelligence tests reveals a troubling reality:
user memory systematically shapes LLMs’ emo-
tional judgments, with identical scenarios produc-
ing markedly different interpretations based on user
profiles. Multiple high-performing models exhibit
larger shifts in emotional understanding for users
with disadvantaged profiles, along with systematic
demographic biases across gender, religion, and
age (Table 1, Figure 3, 4), suggesting that person-
alization may be internalizing social hierarchies
directly into the models’ reasoning processes.

2 Methods

To assess how user memory affects emotional rea-
soning, we created diverse profiles via two meth-
ods: explicit manipulation of social capital and
intersectional control of demographic variables.
LLMs were then evaluated on two validated emo-
tional intelligence tests after removing culturally
variable items.

2.1 User Profile Generation

Explicit user profile generation. We con-
structed user personas by sampling thirty base pro-
files from Persona Hub, each containing a short de-
scription outlining occupation, expertise, and back-
ground(Ge et al., 2025). We then generated two
versions of each persona, drawing on Bourdieu’s
framework (Bourdieu, 1985), which posits four
dimensions of social stratification: Demograph-
ics, Family background, Social connections, and
Personal assets. The advantaged version of each
profile featured demographic privileges, beneficial
connections, and access to resources and opportu-
nities across the four dimensions. Conversely, the
disadvantaged version introduced structural barri-
ers, limited resource access, and challenges in each
dimension (Figure 2). We used DeepSeek-R1 for
profile generation due to its performance in creative
writing tasks (Wu et al., 2025).

Intersectional persona generation. To examine
how demographic identities interact to shape LLM
responses, we extracted demographic information
from the international PRISM dataset (Kirk et al.,
2024). We constructed 81 personas by combining

four demographic dimensions — gender (3), age
(3), religion (3), and ethnicity (3) — each repre-
senting a unique profile. This design allows us to
examine how these demographic characteristics in-
teract to influence LLMs’ emotional understanding.

2.2 Emotional Intelligence Assessment

Emotional understanding (STEU). We em-
ployed the Situational Test of Emotional Under-
standing (STEU) (MacCann and Roberts, 2008), a
validated instrument assessing how accurately in-
dividuals recognize and reason about others’ emo-
tions across 42 hypothetical scenarios, capturing
both emotional recognition and emotional rea-
soning.

Emotional guidance (Modified STEM). To as-
sess emotion-related behavioral recommendations,
we adapted the Situational Test of Emotion Man-
agement (STEM) (MacCann and Roberts, 2008;
Schlegel et al., 2025), which comprises 44 vi-
gnettes depicting individuals experiencing negative
emotions (anger, sadness, fear, or disgust) in per-
sonal and professional contexts. We transformed
the original third-person scenarios into first-person
consultative prompts (e.g., “What should Alex do


when feeling anxious about a presentation?” —
“T’m feeling anxious about my upcoming presenta-
tion. What should I do?’), shifting the task from
abstract emotional judgment to personalized emo-
tional support and enabling assessment of how
LLMs provide emotion-guided behavioral advice.

Human Annotation. The STEU/STEM scales
include a correct answer for each item which
should not vary with the persona. To identify ques-
tions where the correct answers do vary, we had 9
qualified annotators independently review all items
and flag questions which might reasonably vary
across demographic or cultural contexts (e.g., due
to differences in social privilege or lived experi-
ence). Items flagged by 20% annotators were re-
moved following consensus review, resulting in
the exclusion of nine questions from each dataset
(Appendix B for detailed annotation process).

3 Experiments

We evaluated emotional understanding and
emotion-related suggestive behaviors across 15 lan-
guage models spanning architectures and capabil-
ities. We inject memory in the system prompt for
main experiments but also explore other memory
injection methods in ablation studies (Zhang et al.,
2024, 2025b,a). See Appendix A for implementa-
tion details and ablation study results.

In Experiment 1 (RQ1), we evaluated 15 mod-
els on the STEU dataset, comparing performance
with and without explicit user profiles to quantify
the influence of user memory. We reported both
absolute accuracy and flip rate, defined as the pro-
portion of predictions that changed relative to the
No-Memory baseline. Results revealed systematic
behavioral patterns; however, the use of complex
personas (e.g., a full professor at Stanford Univer-
sity vs. an adjunct at a regional university) ham-
pered our ability to isolate demographic effects.
To address this shortcoming, Experiment 2 (RQ2)
employed intersectional personas to quantify how
demographic variables (gender, age, religion, and
ethnicity) influence model responses. Building on
these findings, Experiment 3 (RQ3) used the re-
vised STEM instrument to evaluate three models’
emotion-based behavioral recommendations across
the same intersectional personas.

For RQ2-RQ3, we analyzed errors using mixed-
effects models to estimate demographic effects on
accuracy. The models predicted the probability of a
correct response, with demographic factors as fixed
effects and question-level variation as a random

effect. The baseline was a white, christian, male
aged 25-34; negative coefficients indicated lower
accuracy relative to this group.

4 Results and Discussion

Our experiments reveal three key findings:

Finding 1: User memory systematically influ-
ences emotional understanding. Incorporating
user profiles into model memory significantly al-
tered performance relative to the no-memory base-
line, with statistically significant differences ob-
served in 11 of the 15 evaluated models. For nearly
all affected models, performance decreased once
user memory was introduced, except for GPT-OSS
(Further studied in Appendix E). Interestingly, we
observe significant disparities when given advan-
taged user profiles (wealthy, well-connected users)
compared to disadvantaged profiles (users facing
economic or social barriers) across multiple high-
performing models. Claude 3.7 Sonnet (80.10%
vs.77.37%}), DeepSeek-R1 (81.62% vs.76.57%"),
and Llama 3.2 90B (64.91% vs.62.24%7) all
demonstrate substantial performance gaps favor-
ing advantaged profiles. Disadvantaged profile also
elicits higher flip rate from the No-memory base-
line (Figure 4). Finding 2: Models show demo-
graphic biases in emotional understanding. Sev-
eral models show different bias when profiles are
Muslim, non-binary, or over 65+ (Figure 3, top
panel). For instance, DeepSeek R1 performed bet-
ter with Christian users than with Muslim while
it performed better with older personas. In con-

trast, Qwen 3 4B showed inferior performance
with elderly users compared with middle-aged but
much better performance towards Muslim and non-
binary personas. Models with “thinking” capabil-
ities showed lower biases than their standard ver-
sions. Finding 3: Demographic biases persist
when models give emotional advice. The biases
we found in emotional understanding is also signifi-
cant when models provide emotional guidance and
suggestions. Most bias exists in age and gender
attributes (Figure 3, bottom panel). For instance,
Claude 3.7 was significantly worse at helping fe-
male and non-binary than male personas, while
Qwen 3 4B Thinking continued to perform better
with female and non-binary users. Error Anal-
ysis. We examined reasoning traces from large
reasoning models on misclassified cases. With the
exception of GPT-OSS, most models integrated
persona information during inference, often over-

weighing it and introducing bias (Table 7-8). This
tendency to personalize reasoning led to systematic
performance declines when user memory cues were
present. Correlation analysis (Appendix E.2) fur-
ther revealed that top models shared highly similar
response patterns, reflecting common bias sources,
whereas correlations among other “thinking” mod-
els were low, indicating diversity in reasoning.

5 Conclusions

Our findings reveal a critical paradox in
emotionally-aware AI: attempts to enhance empa-
thy through personalization may inadvertently am-
plify social inequities. Incorporating user memory
consistently alters emotional reasoning, often re-
ducing performance in ways that favor privileged
over disadvantaged personas. This personalization-
fairness tension necessitates novel approaches to
balance adaptive capabilities with equitable perfor-
mance across demographic groups.


6 Limitations

The STEU and STEM tests are validated instru-
ments based on human expert-defined consensus
answers. We further validated the influence of per-
sonas by human experts. Thus, score differences
should be interpreted as correctness.

Importantly, the original tests present third-
person, hypothetical scenarios, yet the models’ re-
sponses varied systematically depending on the
user-specific memory. This finding suggests that
user memory can inappropriately influence general
reasoning, even in contexts that should be user-
independent. We could benefit from doing more
error analysis.

We did not purpose a mitigation strategy. Fu-
ture work should explore mechanisms to disentan-
gle user-specific adaptation from task-general rea-
soning, and investigate mitigation strategies for
memory-induced bias.

A Experiment Settings

STEU and STEM are in English. In Experiment 2
and 3, we include demographics such as age (25-34
years old, 35-64 years old and 65 + years old), gen-
der (male, female or non-binary), religions (non-
religious, Muslim or christian), and race (Asian,
Black and White). We have tested 2520 questions
in experiment 1, 3402 question in experiment 2 and
3564 in experiment 3.

A.1 Memory Implementations

To inject memories, we explicitly encode user
information as structured text within the system
prompt at the start of each interaction, following
the method described in Zhang et al. (2024). This
augmented prompt is concatenated with the user’s
current input and then passed to the LLM. Ablation
studies compare this direct injection method with
memory retrieval-based augmentation, as discussed
in Wang et al. (2024). We use titan text embedding
version 2 as our embeddings with maximum length
equal to 8,192 tokens. Facebook AI SImilarity
Search (FAISS) to implement, and retrieve top 3
relevant sentences per question.

A.2. Hyperparameters

To ensure consistent and high-quality outputs
across different models, we standardized the de-

coding hyperparameters for most model genera-
tions by setting the temperature to 0 (to promote
deterministic outputs), top-p (nucleus sampling)
to 0.95 (to allow for a balance between diversity
and relevance), and a maximum token limit of 128
tokens (Anthropic, 2024; Xu et al., 2025; Zhang
et al., 2025c). Recognizing the enhanced reasoning
capabilities of certain models, we adjusted the con-
figurations accordingly. For Claude 3.7 Thinking,
we Set the thinking budget to be 16k. For R1 and
other reasoning mode, we set max new tokens to be
16k. This is to provide enough budget for reasoning
models to finish thinking.

A.3 Test Scoring

For STEU, the number of correct responses for
each persona was recorded. Models are tested with
or without user memory provided. Mean score is
calculated as the number of correct answers/total
question answered.

The modified STEM responses were scored on a
4-point scale, with points (4 to 1) assigned based
on expert-weighted rankings from highest to low-
est. To ensure deterministic outputs and eliminate
sampling variability, we set the generation tem-
perature to 0 in all experiments. We calculate the
mean scores and standard deviations across user
profiles/personas for each LLM.

A.4 Compute Resources

We use AWS Bedrock batch inference for large
models’ inference, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3.2
90B, Llama 4, Llama 3.1 70B, DeepSeek R1,
and Mistral Large V2. For Claude 3.7 Sonnet
Reasoning and DeepSeek R1, we utilize AWS
cross-region inference. Models such as Qwen2.5-
7B-Instruct, Qwen3-4B, c4ai-command-r7b-12-
2024, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, Phi-4-mini-instruct,
Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-
Llama-8B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B are
accessed via Hugging Face endpoints.

For experiments that require accessing model’s
hidden states and log probs. We run inference on
one EC2 p4d.24zlarge (Nvidia A100 40GiB GPU)
instance and one EC2 p4d.24alarge (Nvidia A100
40GiB GPU) in Sydney(ap-southeast-2) region.
We have used them for 55 to 60 hours for open-
source model inference using VLLM as our infer-
ence framework. We have also attached 8000GiB
disk volume with AL2023 Linux OS image. We
use HuggingFace and PyTorch as the main software


frameworks. W

A.5 Models Used

See Table 2 for specifications and details for all
evaluated large language models.

B Human Labeling

The correct answer of STEU/STEM may influence
be correlated with user personas. In real-world
settings, additional context (e.g., financial hardship,
social privilege) can legitimately change emotional
interpretation. Thus, we used human labeling to
remove questions that could be influenced by user
personas.

B.1 Human Labeling Design

We use Amazon Ground Truth (formerly MTurk)
where annotator expertise cannot be pre-filtered,
so we screen for persona sensitivity in two phases.
First, each EQ question is shown without any per-
sona and we retain only responses from annotators
who answer correctly (quality gate). Second, for
each retained question, we randomly sampled two
personas — one advantaged and one disadvantaged
— and asked whether two annotators with those per-
sonas, both aiming to be correct on a third-person
question, would give different answers. We col-
lect answers until we have nine valid annotations
per second question. We also ask each each an-
notator judge three persona pairs (advantaged vs.
disadvantaged). Each question is judged per 9 an-
notators given 3 different personas pair. They judge
each question 2 independently. We paid each an-
notator 0.96 dollar per question set and did not
enable automated data labeling. We then dropped
any question for which > 20% of these judgments
indicate different answers, and we discarded anno-
tations completed in less than minutes (speeding
filter). Applying these rules led us to remove nine
questions in each dataset. We provide an example
in Table 3.

C_ Ablation Study Results

The ablation study compared two memory injection
methods using direct injection method or memory
retrieval-based augmentation. As shown in Table
4, the two methods yielded similar results where
advantaged profiles received significantly higher
performance compared to disadvantaged profiles.
To avoid retrieving algorithm’s influence on results,

we used the first approach for the main experi-
ments.

D Mixed Effects Model

We ran separate mixed effects models for each
LLM and report and compare the coefficients. Each
mixed effects model is specified as:

y=X6+Zut+e (1)

In this hierarchical modeling framework, fixed ef-
fects represent population-level parameters that are
constant across all decision questions, while ran-
dom effects capture question-specific deviations
that are assumed to follow a normal distribution.
Here, y is a 0/1 variable indicating whether the
question was answered correctly, X is the design
matrix for the fixed effect predictors (with columns
for intercept, age, gender, and race), ( is the vector
of coefficients for the fixed effects representing the
average population-level associations, Z is the de-
sign matrix for the random effects (with columns
for the question number and its interactions with
each of the three demographic variables), u is the
vector of random effect coefficients representing
question-specific deviations from the population
averages (with u ~ (0, G)), and é is the vector
of error terms for each observation. Because all
models use identical input data and model specifi-
cations, the resulting coefficients are directly com-
parable and reveal differences in how each LLM
responds to demographic information. While mod-
els may differ in overall performance (captured by
the overall intercept), the slope coefficients isolate
demographic effects independent of baseline accu-
racy.

We fit the models in python (statsmodels) to
estimate 3, u, and 95% confidence intervals around
these terms. Figure 3 reports the G coefficients and
confidence intervals.

E_ Error Analysis

E.1 Reasoning Models Error Deep Dive

We classify errors into five main types. (i) Persona
Distraction occurs when irrelevant persona details
influence the reasoning process. (ii) Complexity
Overreach involves the unnecessary exploration of
irrelevant pathways, complicating the solution. (iii)
Logic Inconsistency manifests as incoherent rea-
soning with disconnected conclusions. (iv) Context
Fabrication is the generation of fictional scenarios

or constraints not present in the original query. (v)
Priority Misalignment describes the LLMs’ fail-
ure to distinguish between critical and trivial in-
formation, leading to misguided focus in problem-
solving. These categories encompass the primary
ways in which LLM may deviate from effective
reasoning and problem-solving (See example in
Figure 4).

We use claude 4 sonnet and gpt oss 120B to
classify all errors in emotional understanding ex-
periments. We have shared our prompt in Table 6
If they disagree on any question, we will show both
models’ reasoning process and final answer for hu-
man to judge. Each question with disagreement is
judged by 9 annotators. We filter out any answer
completed by | min and do maximum vote to get
final error clasisfication. We share the result of dis-
advantaged personas in Figure 7 and advanataged
personas in Figure 8.

Advantaged version in general lead to all kinds
of errors instead of just persona distraction. This
demonstrates that LLM’s overall reasoning capa-
bility decreases after injecting disadvantaged per-
sonas. Notiably, the disadvantaged version demon-
strated a significant error rate in priority misalign-
ment, where LLMs struggled to effectively dif-
ferentiate between critical and peripheral informa-
tion within queries. This manifested as either an
overemphasis on irrelevant details during reason-
ing processes or the oversight of crucial informa-
tion. GPT OSS 120B showed greater resilience
against such distractions when operating with dis-

advantaged personas and maintained more focused
reasoning patterns. This explains why it performs
better with memory.

annotator answer the question | correctly and spend 2 mins in total.

Question 1 This is a standard EQ test and please be as objective as possible. The question is
about the 3rd person you do not know in person. Please assume there is one correct
answer which is better than the rest. Answer the following question:

Shona has not spoken to her nephew for months, whereas when he was younger they
were very close. She rings him but he can only talk for five minutes. What action
would be the most effective for Shona?

A. Realize that he is growing up and might not want to spend so much time with
his family any more.

B. Make plans to drop by and visit him in person and have a good chat.
C. Understand that relationships change, but keep calling him from time to time.

D. Be upset about it, but realize there is nothing she can do.

Table 6: The prompt for error classification of emotional understanding responses.

<instruction>
You are a model for analyzing the errors made by a chatbot in an emotional understanding question.

Your task is to review the provided information, including the chatbot’s memory about the person,
the question and the chatbot’s answer, the correct answer, and the chatbot’s reasoning.

Based on this information, you will classify the error made by the chatbot according to the following
potential error classifications:

<error_classifications>

A. Persona Distraction: The chatbot uses any information from personas [LLM_PERSONAS] during
reasoning stage [LLM_REASONING].

B. Complexity Overreach: The chatbot creates unnecessary complexity by exploring multiple irrele-
vant pathways in [LLM_REASONING] that don’t contribute to the final answer [LLM_ANSWER].

C. Logic Inconsistency: The reasoning process in [LLM_REASONING] lacks coherent progression
and jumps between different answers without clear connections.

D. Context Fabrication: The chatbot generates additional scenarios or assumptions in
[LLM_REASONING] not present in the original question [QUESTION] or personas
[LLM_PERSONAS].

E. Priority Misalignment: The chatbot fails to distinguish between critical information and useless
details in the given question [QUESTION]. This error results in using useless details in reasoning
[LLM_REASONING].

F. None of the above.
</error_classifications>

<guidelines>

- If the LLM is asking for help with an emotional understanding question, the answer should not
retrieve any persona information.

- If [LLM_REASONING] has no reasoning, you should classify it as "none of the above" /
<answer>F</answer>, which is extremely uncommon.

- If [LLM_REASONING] is extremely short, you may classify it as "none of the above" /
<answer>F</answer> if you believe there is not enough information to make a classification.

- One reasoning could have multiple errors. In that case, you should provide all applicable error
choices, such as <answer>AD</answer> or <answer>BCE</answer>.

- If [LLM_PERSONAS] is NA. Then, the error classifications cannot be A.

</guidelines

The conversation will be presented in the following format:

[LLM_PERSONAS]

[QUESTION]

[CORRECT_ANSWER]

[LLM_ANSWER]

[LLM_REASONING]

The answer is incorrect, which means the reasoning is incorrect.

Your classification should only apply to the last message marked by [LLM_REASONING].
The prior messages are included to provide context for classifying the final message.

</instruction>

<output_format>

Provide your classification choice in the <answer></answer> tag, as well as your confidence level
from 1-5 (1 being least confident, 5 being most confident) in the <score></score> tag.
