Abstract

While media bias is widely studied, the epis-
temic strategies behind factual reporting remain
computationally underexplored. This paper an-
alyzes these strategies through a large-scale
comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we em-
ploy an article matching strategy to compare
reports on the same events and apply the FAC-
TAPPEAL framework to a corpus of over 470K
articles covering two highly politicized periods:
the COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas
war. We find that CNN’s reporting contains
more factual statements and is more likely to
ground them in external sources. The outlets
also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns:
CNN builds credibility by citing Experts and
Expert Documents, constructing an appeal to
formal authority, whereas Fox News favors
News Reports and direct quotations. This
work quantifies how partisan outlets use sys-
tematically different epistemic strategies to con-
struct reality, adding a new dimension to the
study of media bias.

1 Introduction

In a fragmented and polarized media ecosystem,
the question of how news outlets present reality has
profound implications for democratic discourse.
Partisan news sources do not merely offer differ-
ent opinions; they often construct divergent factual
narratives around the same events, creating distinct
“epistemic worlds” for their audiences (Iyengar and
Hahn, 2009; Broockman and Kalla, 2025). This
divergence is achieved not only through topic se-
lection—what has been termed “partisan coverage
filtering” (Broockman and Kalla, 2025)—but also
through subtle linguistic choices in how informa-
tion is framed (Entman, 1993), which facts are
presented, and crucially, which sources are invoked
to lend those facts authority.

This study focuses on CNN and Fox News, two
of the most influential news organizations in the

United States, both of which have been shown to
operate as partisan outlets. While foundational
research on their television broadcasts has demon-
strated their power to causally shift political pref-
erences and impact election outcomes (Ash et al.,
2024), their online news platforms are formidable
forces in their own right. According to recent in-
dustry analyses, CNN.com and FoxNews.com con-
sistently rank among the most visited news web-
sites in the US, surpassed only by legacy outlets
like The New York Times (Press Gazette, 2025).
Prior work has powerfully documented the effects
of “partisan coverage filtering” on television—the
strategic selection and omission of facts—which
shapes audience beliefs and attitudes (Broockman
and Kalla, 2025). However, these studies primar-
ily reveal what topics are covered differently. The
more granular question of how these outlets rhetori-
cally construct factual authority within their report-
ing remains computationally underexplored. This
study, therefore, moves beyond topic selection to
provide the first large-scale computational analy-
sis of the epistemic and sourcing strategies used
in their widely-read digital articles, offering a new
lens to understand the mechanics of partisan media
in the digital age.

How is a factual claim made credible? A news
report can present a “brute fact” on its own author-
ity, or it can anchor the claim in an external source
of knowledge—an official, an expert, a witness, or
a document. This choice of whether to appeal to
a source, and which type of source to appeal to,
is a central journalistic practice (Schudson, 2003)
that shapes the perceived legitimacy of informa-
tion (Carlson, 2017). The differential use of these
epistemic appeals may represent a powerful, yet
computationally understudied, form of media bias.

In this work, we conduct a large-scale computa-
tional analysis of epistemic and sourcing strategies
in partisan news. We investigate whether right-
leaning (Fox News) and left-leaning (CNN) media


outlets exhibit systematic differences in (1) the pro-
portion of factual versus non-factual statements;
(2) the tendency to support factual claims with ex-
plicit epistemic appeals; and (3) the distribution
of source types (e.g., Officials, Experts) used to
validate claims.

To address these questions, we leverage the Fac-
tAppeal annotation framework (Mor-Lan et al.,
2025), a detailed scheme for identifying factual
claims and the structure of their epistemic appeals.
We apply a model trained on this scheme to a new,
curated corpus of news articles from CNN and Fox
News. To isolate stylistic differences from topic
selection bias, we use an article matching strategy
to compare reports covering the same events dur-
ing two highly polarized periods: the COVID-19
pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war.

Our findings reveal significant and systematic
differences in the epistemic postures of the two
outlets. We show that while both outlets are pre-
dominantly factual, they diverge sharply in how
they source their claims, with Fox News prioritiz-
ing appeals to other media and direct quotes, while
CNN prioritizes appeals to formal expertise. This
research contributes a novel, quantitative method-
ology for analyzing sourcing as a vector of media
bias and provides empirical evidence of the distinct
ways partisan outlets build factual authority.

2 Related Work

This study is situated at the intersection of compu-
tational linguistics, political communication, and
journalism studies. We build on research in three
primary areas: computational analysis of media
bias, the study of journalistic sourcing, and NLP
for epistemic analysis.

2.1 Computational Analysis of Media Bias

The computational study of media bias has a rich
history, moving from lexical choices (Gentzkow
and Shapiro, 2010) to more nuanced phenomena
like framing (Entman, 1993; Card et al., 2015).
A key mechanism of framing in modern partisan
media is “partisan coverage filtering,’ where out-
lets selectively report facts favorable to their side
(Broockman and Kalla, 2025). Recent work has
also used unsupervised methods combining named
entity recognition and stance analysis to cluster out-
lets based on topic and portrayal patterns (Benson
and Cruickshank, 2023; de Vries et al., 2022).
Our work extends this tradition by proposing that

epistemic structure—the very manner in which a
factual claim is presented and supported—is itself
a powerful framing device. Instead of focusing
only on what is said or filtered, we analyze how the
remaining claims are made credible. This moves
beyond lexical or topic bias to what can be termed
“epistemic bias” or “source bias.”

2.2 Journalistic Sourcing and Authority

Sociologists of news have long argued that sourc-
ing practices are central to the construction of news
narratives (Schudson, 2003), often leading jour-
nalists to ’index” their coverage to the range of
opinions found among elite political sources (Ben-
nett, 1990). The choice of sources is not neutral;
it confers legitimacy on certain viewpoints while
marginalizing others (Carlson, 2017). This can lead
to phenomena like “false balance,” where giving
equal weight to unequal sides creates a distorted
perception of evidence, a form of epistemic harm
(Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004; Terzian, 2025).

In a partisan context, source selection is also a
persuasive tool. Citing a source already trusted
by a particular audience segment can increase a
report’s persuasive power for that segment (Iyengar
and Hahn, 2009). Our work provides a compu-
tational method to systematically measure these
sourcing patterns at scale, operationalizing them
as a quantifiable vector of media influence. While
some studies have found that sustained exposure to
cross-cutting media can moderate attitudes despite
source distrust (Broockman and Kalla, 2025), oth-
ers find that it primarily erodes trust in all media
(Guess et al., 2021), highlighting the complex role
of sourcing.

This sociological perspective can be enriched by
the framework of social epistemology, which exam-
ines the social practices that facilitate or hinder the
creation of knowledge (Goldman, 1999). From this
view, journalistic sourcing is not just a persuasive
tool but a core epistemic practice. The systematic
preference for certain source types over others can
lead to what philosopher Miranda Fricker terms
“testimonial injustice,’ where the credibility of cer-
tain knowers is unfairly diminished (Fricker, 2007).
Furthermore, as argued by C. Thi Nguyen, such
practices are central to the distinction between an
“epistemic bubble” (a simple lack of information)
and a more pernicious “echo chamber,’ which ac-
tively works to discredit outside sources of author-
ity (Nguyen, 2020).


2.3 Epistemic Analysis in NLP

Within NLP, our research builds on work in claim
detection, fact-checking, and argumentation min-
ing. Large-scale datasets like FEVER (Thorne
et al., 2018) have driven progress in verifying
claims against evidence, and argumentation mining
seeks to identify claim-premise structures (Feng
and Hirst, 2011). However, these tasks typically do
not provide a detailed typology of the kind of evi-
dence or authority being invoked, nor do they cap-
ture nuanced factual relationships (Mor-Lan and
Levi, 2024). Similarly, while stance detection iden-
tifies a text’s position on a target, it does not analyze
the evidentiary basis of factual claims (Kii¢tik and
Can, 2020; Hardalov et al., 2022).

The FactAppeal framework (Mor-Lan et al.,
2025), upon which our study is based, was designed
to fill this gap. It provides a rich, theory-driven
schema for not just identifying a factual claim, but
for detailing how it is epistemically grounded via
appeals to different kinds of sources. By applying
this fine-grained analytical lens to a partisan news
corpus, we move from general claim detection to
a nuanced analysis of how partisan arguments are
constructed and justified.

3 Methodology

Our analytical approach is structured as a concep-
tual funnel (Figure 1), which allows us to system-
atically compare how journalistic outlets construct
factual claims. The analysis begins at the broad-
est level—all sentences within a text—and pro-
gressively narrows its scope. We first identify the
subset of sentences that make factual claims, then
the subset of those that ground their claims in an
epistemic appeal, and finally, we analyze the fine-
grained characteristics of these appeals, such as
source type and quotation style.

3.1 The FactAppeal Framework

Our analysis relies on the FactAppeal annota-
tion scheme, a span-level framework for identi-
fying the epistemic structure of factual claims in
news text (Mor-Lan et al., 2025). The scheme
first distinguishes sentences that make factual
claims—statements about the state of the external
world—from non-factual content. Factual claims
are then categorized as either a Fact Without Ap-
peal (a brute fact presented on the author’s author-
ity) or a Fact With Appeal.

For sentences containing a Fact With Appeal,

the framework annotates the Source of the appeal
and classifies it into a typology grounded in the
nature of its authority (Mor-Lan et al., 2025). Key
source types include:

¢ Official: An actor with non-epistemic author-
ity (e.g., political, legal) over the events.

¢ Expert: A source whose authority derives
from specialized, general knowledge (e.g., a
scientist, an analyst).

¢ Active Participant: An actor with a direct,
firsthand role in the events.

¢ Witness: An observer with firsthand testi-
mony but not an active role.

¢ Direct Evidence: Non-human evidence from
the scene (e.g., a photo, a document).

¢ News Report: An appeal to a journalistic
news report.

¢ Expert Document: An appeal to a formal,
expert document (e.g., a scientific study, an
institutional report).

The scheme also annotates other features, such as
whether the source is explicitly named, whether
the appeal involves a direct or indirect quote, and
other characteristics such as attributes of the source
(role, title or credentials) or of the epistemic appeal,
such as the time or location in which the appeal
was made (Mor-Lan et al., 2025).

To illustrate, the following example shows how
a sentence is annotated with XML-style tags to
capture its epistemic structure.

<Source:Named:Official> Doug Ericksen, </Source>
<Source_Attribute> the EPA’s communications
director for the transition, </Source_
Attribute> told <Recipient> National Public
Radio </Recipient> that <Fact_Appeal:Direct>
‘*we’11l take a look at what’s happening so that
the voice coming from the EPA is one that’s
going to reflect the new administration.” </Fact_
Appeal>

This fine-grained annotation allows us to move
beyond simple claim detection to a nuanced analy-
sis of how factual claims are constructed and justi-
fied.

3.2 Data Collection

We gathered a corpus of news articles from the web-
sites of CNN (left-leaning) and Fox News (right-
leaning) via the Webz.io API. The data covers two
broad periods: February 2020 to June 2022 and
September 2023 to June 2025. The final annotated
corpus consists of 476K articles, comprising 16.5M
sentences. Table 1 provides a summary.!

3.3 Article Matching

Differences between news outlets can arise from
their editorial choices about what stories to cover,
or how they frame and report on the same story.
Topic selection acts as a powerful confounding vari-
able: a simple comparison between outlets might
incorrectly attribute differences in reporting style
to the outlets themselves, when they are actually
due to the different events and stories each chooses
to cover, which may lend themselves to different
sourcing patterns. For example, Lifestyle articles
might naturally contain fewer epistemic appeals
and fewer appeals to experts. To isolate the effect
of reporting style from this topic-selection bias, we
employ a matching strategy analogous to methods
used in statistics to control for confounders. By
pairing articles that cover the same event, we can
more directly attribute any observed differences to
the framing and journalistic practices of the out-
lets. This approach allows us to approximate a
controlled comparison, conditioning our analysis
on the underlying story.

'The 2" period contains considerably more video-only
items, which are filtered.

Our matching procedure operates daily. For each
day t in our corpus, let A; and B; represent the sets
of articles from the two outlets. We first represent
each article’s title as a vector embedding, v, us-
ing OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small model.
Then, for each article a € A;, we calculate its max-
imum cosine similarity against the set of articles
published by the opposing outlet on the same day.
This yields a similarity score for article a, denoted
Sim(a), defined as:

Sim(a) = max (at we )
be Br \ ||Vall|lvoll

This process is applied symmetrically to assign
a similarity score to every article from both outlets.
Each article in the corpus is thus associated with
a score representing its strongest topical link to
an article from the other source on the day of its
publication.

As shown by the stratified random sample of
matched titles in Table 2, this score effectively
captures topical alignment. High-similarity scores
correspond to articles covering the same specific
event, while medium scores indicate a shared gen-
eral topic. Based on this, we partition the en-
tire corpus of articles C = A U B into three
disjoint analytical groups: the High-Similarity
group, Ghigh = {a € C | Sim(a) > 0.6}; the
Mid-Similarity group, Gig = {a € C | 0.3 <
Sim(a) < 0.6}; and the Low-Similarity group,
Giow = {a € C'| Sim(a) < 0.3}.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of these similar-
ity scores and the resulting proportion of articles
in each group. We sample 100 pairs of titles from
Ghigh for manual validation, and observe that all
matched articles report on the same event or story.
For additional examples of matched titles in the
high similarity group, see Table 3 in the appendix.
This tiered approach allows us to analyze differ-
ences in reporting practices while controlling for
the degree of topical overlap between the articles.

3.4 Model Inference

We segment each article into sentences using the
SpaCy segmentizer model. We then process each
sentence using FACTAPPEAL’s best performing
checkpoint, a fine-tuned Gemma-2-9B decoder,
achieving a macro-F' score of 0.73 (Mor-Lan et al.,
2025). The trained model is prompted to reproduce
each input sentence with XML-style tags inserted
to indicate features of epistemic appeals. Table 4
in the appendix shows a side-by-side comparison
of two example articles annotated by the model.
Inference is performed on an A100 GPU using the
vLLM framework. Following inference, we parse
the tags and create counts of each feature.

4 Analysis and Results

Our analysis reveals systematic differences in the
epistemic strategies employed by CNN and Fox
News. We examine these differences by calculating
several conditional probabilities, comparing the
outlets across our three similarity groups to control
for topic selection effects.

4.1 Factuality and Propensity to Appeal

We first measure the outlets’ general journalistic
posture: the tendency to report facts and to ground
those facts in external sources. Figure 3 shows the
difference between CNN and Fox News in three
key probabilities:

¢ P(Fact|Sentence): The probability that a
given sentence contains a factual claim.

¢ P(Appeal|Fact): The probability that a fac-
tual claim is supported by an epistemic ap-
peal.

¢ P(Named|Source): The probability that a
cited source is identified by name.

Our results show a clear and consistent pat-
tern. Sentences in CNN articles are significantly
more likely to express factual statements across

all similarity groups. Furthermore, when a factual
statement is made, CNN is more likely to accom-
pany it with an epistemic appeal, except in the
low-similarity group where the finding is reversed.
Finally, CNN is also more likely to identify its
sources by name.

These findings suggest a fundamental difference
in journalistic style. CNN’s reporting exhibits a
greater orientation toward fact-based statements
that are explicitly anchored to named, external au-
thorities. This aligns with a traditional journalistic
norm of transparently sourced, evidence-based re-
porting.

4.2 Divergent Sourcing Strategies

Beyond the frequency of appeals, the type of source
invoked reveals deeper strategic differences. Figure
4 shows the difference in the conditional probability
of citing each source type, P(Type = t|Source).
Here, the two outlets display starkly diver-
gent patterns. CNN consistently shows a signif-
icantly higher propensity to cite Experts, Expert
Documents, and Officials. This pattern suggests
a strategy of building credibility through appeals
to formal, institutional, and scientific authority.
Conversely, Fox News relies significantly more
on News Reports and Direct Evidence. The re-
liance on other news reports may indicate a greater
role in inter-media agenda-setting or the creation
of a self-referential media ecosystem. The prefer-
ence for Direct Evidence suggests an appeal to
unmediated, “raw” proof, perhaps reflecting a de-
gree of skepticism toward expert- or official-based
sources. Again, the occurrence of these differences
in the high-similarity group, where both outlets
cover the same story, indicates this is a framing

choice rather than a byproduct of topic selection.

4.3 Characteristics of Appeals

Finally, we examine finer-grained features of the
epistemic appeals themselves (Figure 5). CNN is
more likely to report the Source Attribute (e.g.,
role or credentials) and the Time and Location of
the appeal, providing richer contextual information
that further serves to credentialize the source.
CNN is also more likely to utilize indirect quo-
tations, in which the epistemic source’s words are
paraphrased and mediated. In contrast, Fox News
is significantly more likely to use a Direct_Quote.
This preference for verbatim quotation, combined
with its lower rate of providing source attributes,
suggests a strategy that prioritizes conveying a
source’s message with seemingly unfiltered imme-
diacy, rather than contextualizing their authority.

4.4 Topic and Expertise Analysis

To test the robustness of these findings, we con-
ducted a topic-level analysis using an LDA topic
model (Blei et al., 2003). As shown in Figure 6, the
higher factuality rate for CNN (P(Fact|Sentence))
is consistent across nearly all topics. However, the
differences in the propensity to make appeals and to
cite experts vary by topic, suggesting that sourcing

strategies are also context-dependent.

We observe the greatest disparity in reporting
practices across topics that are highly politically
polarizing yet fundamentally reliant on substan-
tive factual claims (i.e., non-normative dimensions).
These topics include immigration and health, the
COVID-19 pandemic, climate and energy, and
crime and policing. The heightened differences
in these areas indicate that the choice of epistemic
strategy is actively leveraged to construct distinct
narratives around politically charged facts.

Given that the preference for Expert sources is
one of the most pronounced differences, we per-
formed a deeper analysis of the specific expert
spans cited by each outlet. Figure 7 displays the
most common expert spans cited by each outlets,
as well as the most distinctive spans, which we
calculate using weighted log-odds (Monroe et al.,
2008). While the top expert spans are generally
shared on the two venues, their ordering and rela-
tive shares differ. The CDC is the most distinctive
expert source for CNN, reflecting its focus on pub-
lic health expertise during the pandemic. Both
outlets rely on their own in-house experts (e.g.,
Steve Vladeck for CNN, Dr. Marc Siegel for Fox
News), reinforcing their respective authority net-
works. Notably, one of the most distinctive expert-
like sources for Fox News is “Critics,” suggesting a
strategy of framing issues through an oppositional

lens, even when the source of criticism is not a
traditional expert.

5 Discussion

The results paint a clear picture of divergent jour-
nalistic epistemologies in partisan news. While
both CNN and Fox News heavily engage in factual
reporting, the way they construct the authority for
those facts differs systematically.

CNN’s approach can be characterized as an ap-
peal to formal, institutional authority. Its higher
rate of factuality and appeals, its preference for
experts and official documents, and its tendency
to provide source credentials all work to project
an image of objective, evidence-based journalism.
This strategy aligns with traditional journalistic
norms and may appeal to an audience that values
institutional credibility.

Fox News, in contrast, employs a strategy that
can be described as an appeal to media-centric
and unmediated authority. Its greater reliance on
other news reports creates a more self-referential
information environment, while its preference for
direct quotes and direct evidence creates a sense of
immediacy and raw, unfiltered truth. The frequent
citation of “critics” as an authority further frames
news as a landscape of conflict.

These distinct sourcing patterns contribute to the
creation of separate epistemic worlds for their audi-
ences. Audiences are not only exposed to different
facts via partisan coverage filtering (Broockman
and Kalla, 2025), but are also socialized into dif-
ferent models of what constitutes a valid source of
knowledge. Over time, this can lead to a situation
where a claim’s credibility is judged not on its own
merits, but on whether it comes from an “approved”
type of source for one’s political tribe. This “epis-
temic skewing” deepens polarization by eroding
the common ground for factual debate, making
cross-partisan communication increasingly diffi-
cult. These distinct sourcing patterns are the very
mechanism by which epistemic “echo chambers”
are constructed and maintained (Nguyen, 2020).
By consistently elevating certain types of sources
while implicitly downplaying others, partisan out-
lets instruct their audiences not just on what to
believe, but on who to believe, thereby inoculating
them against countervailing evidence.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced a novel computational
approach to analyze sourcing and epistemic ap-
peals as a dimension of media bias. By applying
a fine-grained classification model to a matched
corpus of articles from CNN and Fox News, we
demonstrated that these outlets employ systemat-
ically different strategies to ground their factual

claims. Our findings quantify how partisan media
outlets construct different authoritative realities for
their audiences, moving beyond lexical or topic
bias to reveal a deeper, structural “epistemic bias.”
This work opens new avenues for the large-scale,
empirical study of journalistic sourcing and pro-
vides a valuable tool for researchers, educators, and
consumers seeking to understand the mechanisms
of media polarization.


Limitations

While this study provides a robust, large-scale anal-
ysis of epistemic strategies, its findings should be
considered in light of several limitations that also
point toward avenues for future research.

First, the scope of our corpus, while large, has
boundaries. Our analysis is confined to two major
US-based partisan outlets, CNN and Fox News.
This binary comparison illuminates the strategies
at two poles of the mainstream media spectrum but
does not capture the practices of centrist outlets
(e.g., Associated Press, Reuters), non-US media,
or the rapidly growing ecosystem of hyper-partisan
and independent digital media. Furthermore, our
study focuses exclusively on digital news articles.
The epistemic and sourcing strategies employed
in television broadcasts, podcasts, or social media
posts from these same outlets may differ due to
the distinct affordances and constraints of those
mediums.

Second, there are methodological limitations in-
herent in our analytical approach. Our analysis is
conducted at the sentence level, which, while en-
abling a granular classification of claims, does not
capture larger discourse structures. For example,
a source may be introduced with full credentials
in one sentence but referred to only by pronoun in
subsequent sentences; our model would not link
these subsequent claims to the original, fully cre-
dentialed source. This approach also cannot assess
the relative prominence of a sourced claim within
an article—a claim in the lead paragraph carries
different weight than one in the final paragraph.
Additionally, our article-matching strategy, which
relies on title similarity, is a powerful heuristic for
controlling for topic selection but is not infallible.
While the method has extremely high precision
(with all manually reviewed matched pairs in the
high similarity group in fact reporting on the same
event or story) its recall might be lower if articles
covering the same event or story happen to have
very different titles.

Third, our analysis relies on automated classifi-
cation. While the underlying model is robust and
achieves a relatively high macro-F’', score, it is nev-
ertheless imperfect, which introduces a degree of
noise into the aggregate results.

More broadly, our study demonstrates a strong
correlation between media outlets and specific epis-
temic strategies, but it cannot determine causality
or intent. We can only speculate whether these

divergent patterns are conscious editorial choices
aimed at persuasion or the result of ingrained, dif-
fering journalistic cultures. Similarly, while we
analyze the textual construction of authority, we
do not measure the downstream effects on audi-
ence trust, belief, or polarization. Exploring these
audience-level effects remains a critical area for
future research, which could combine our compu-
tational methods with surveys and experimental
designs.
