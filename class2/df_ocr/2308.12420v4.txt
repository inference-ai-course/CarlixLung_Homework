Abstract

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) faces increasing environmental scrutiny, particularly
concerning the energy consumption of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and
broader Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. However, existing systematic
literature reviews of DLT rely on limited analyses of citations, abstracts, and keywords, failing to
fully capture the field’s complexity and ESG concerns. We address these challenges by analyzing
the full text of 24,539 publications using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with our manually
labeled Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset of 39,427 entities for DLT. This methodology
identified 505 key publications at the DLT/ESG intersection, enabling comprehensive domain
analysis.

Our combined NLP and temporal graph analysis reveals critical trends in DLT evolution
and ESG impacts, including cryptography and peer-to-peer networks research’s foundational
influence, Bitcoin’s persistent impact on research and environmental concerns (a “Lindy effect’),
Ethereum’s catalytic role on Proof of Stake (PoS) and smart contract adoption, and the industry’s
progressive shift toward energy-efficient consensus mechanisms.

Our contributions include the first DLT-specific NER dataset addressing the scarcity of high-
quality labeled NLP data in blockchain research, a methodology integrating NLP and temporal
graph analysis for large-scale interdisciplinary literature reviews, and the first NLP-driven litera-
ture review focusing on DLT’s ESG aspects.

1. Introduction

Emerging technologies are facing increased scrutiny regarding their energy consumption and
broader ecological impacts, including the use of vital resources such as water, precious met-
als, and synthetic compounds (Platt et al., 2021; Simone et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024). This
growing environmental awareness necessitates evaluating technological advancements through
their ecological footprint, with DLT being no exception. While DLT offers promising features
like record immutability and decentralization, it also presents challenges, particularly the high
energy consumption of specific consensus algorithms. For instance, Bitcoin’s PoW (Nakamoto,
2008), designed to prevent Sybil attacks, in which malicious actors pretend to be multiple users,
has significant energy requirements (Ibafiez & Freier, 2023).

The rapid evolution and interest in DLT have led to a growing number of publications and
intensified scrutiny of its ecological footprint. Yet, persistent misconceptions about its energy
consumption patterns have complicated objective assessment. Additionally, the complexity of
DLT extends well beyond environmental considerations. DLT spans breakthroughs in security,
cryptography, network design, and diverse applications, leading to a rapidly expanding body of
research. Therefore, traditional systematic literature review methodologies and manual literature
analysis techniques that primarily rely on citation metrics, abstract analyses, and database term
searches demonstrate increasing insufficiency in capturing the multidimensional nature and full
scope of the rapidly evolving DLT domain.

We address this complexity by turning to NLP, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
linguistics. NLP offers powerful tools to examine the growing body of DLT literature, from
academic articles to industry whitepapers. Among its various applications, we focus on NER
to identify specific DLT technologies (e.g., PoW and PoS) and their ESG implications (e.g.,
“energy consumption” and “computational power”) within our dataset. This approach allows us
to understand the shifts in research across different DLT technologies and their environmental
impacts.

Building on precedents from the biomedical field, where ontologies or hierarchical tax-
onomies are used to create NER datasets for NLP-driven literature mining and review (Alsheikh
et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2020; Mcentire et al., 2016; Nabi et al., 2022;
Spasic et al., 2005), we have successfully transferred these methods to the DLT domain. Unlike
previous systematic literature reviews that rely on citation measures, abstract analyses, keywords,
or database term searches, our approach examines the entire body of each publication. This al-
lows us to capture all relevant entities under top-level categories representing the whole DLT
field, removing the need for exhaustive database term searches to generate a dataset representing
the DLT field and enabling us to work at scale. By mapping each publication’s tokens to the
hierarchical DLT taxonomy from Tasca and Tessone (2017), which we extended to include ESG
considerations and other categories, we detected thematic shifts in both academic research and
industry publications (e.g., whitepapers). As a result, we compiled a more inclusive dataset that
reflects the DLT field’s overall evolution while preserving the methodological rigor demonstrated
in biomedical literature studies.

Our research makes the following contributions:

e Creating a manually labeled NER dataset of 39,427 named entities for twelve top-level
DLT’s taxonomy categories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first NER dataset
explicitly designed for DLT. Our dataset aims to address the NLP data scarcity issue in
blockchain research. By making it openly available, we help overcome common limita-

tions like high labeling costs and complex access to high-quality labeled NLP data in the
DLT field.!

Presenting a methodological framework for executing an NLP-driven systematic literature
review at the intersection of domains, in this case, DLT and ESG research. Our methodol-
ogy combines approaches from different publications and fields for domain-specific liter-
ature text mining and systematic literature reviews.

Conducting the first NLP-driven systematic literature review for the DLT field that places
a special emphasis on ESG aspects, deriving empirical insights into the evolution of the
literature.

Our work, particularly our NER dataset, can potentially support future NLP data-driven stud-
ies in the DLT field. Additionally, it represents a foundation for future research to improve
automated systematic literature review processes at scale, capable of capturing the intrinsic de-
pendencies and evolution of concepts related to the intersection of fields.

2. Related work

Systematic Reviews in DLT. Previous literature reviews have extensively explored blockchain
applications in various sectors (Casino et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2018). These reviews, how-
ever, differ in scope and depth compared to our systematic review, particularly in terms of the
number of analyzed articles. Previous studies have mainly focused on blockchain’s role in de-
centralization and privacy and analyzed trends of centralization in decentralized systems such as
Bitcoin and Ethereum (Sai et al., 2021). Spychiger et al. (2021) deconstructed 107 blockchain
technologies using a specific taxonomy, emphasizing consensus mechanisms and cryptographic
primitives. Our work, in contrast, provides a broader perspective on the evolution of DLT, in-
cluding its ESG implications, and uses a bigger corpus.

ESG Implications. Bilal et al. (2014), Jiang et al. (2022), Mengelkamp et al. (2018), Poberezhna
(2018), Richardson and Xu (2020), Schulz and Feist (2021), and Wu et al. (2022) have explored
blockchain’s potential in energy management, environmental sustainability, carbon trading, and
transparent reporting. Our study extends these approaches by examining the intersection of ESG
and DLT through a literature analysis.

NLP Applications. Studies have demonstrated NLP’s effectiveness in automated ESG scoring
(Alik Sokolov et al., 2021) and opinion summarization (Dubey et al., 2023). Outside DLT,
systematic reviews using NLP-driven methodologies, particularly in medical genomics (Alsheikh
et al., 2022), have employed database term searches and abstract-based filtering, contrasting with
our approach that uses a taxonomy, labeled NER dataset, and language model to compile and
filter a more inclusive corpus representing the DLT field and from which we derive insights.

2.1. Literature reviews of DLT application in industry sectors

Supply Chain Applications. Blockchain applications in supply chain management have been ex-
tensively studied (Casella et al., 2023; Ibafiez et al., 2025; Wannenwetsch et al., 2023), focusing
on traceability, transparency, and process automation. These reviews highlight blockchain’s role
in enhancing supply chain visibility and reducing intermediary dependencies.

Internet of Things (IoT) Integration. Research examining blockchain-IoT integration (Alladi et
al., 2019; H. N. Dai et al., 2019; Lo et al., 2019; Sallam et al., 2021) has emphasized secu-
rity enhancement, data integrity, and decentralized device management. Studies have particu-
larly focused on scalability challenges (Liu et al., 2025) and consensus mechanisms suitable for
resource-constrained IoT devices.

Healthcare Systems. Literature reviews in healthcare applications (Ghosh & Das, 2020; Hussien
et al., 2019; Khatoon, 2020) have explored blockchain’s potential for secure health records man-
agement, clinical trial data integrity, and pharmaceutical supply chain tracking.

Financial Sector. Blockchain-based shared ledgers have long been studied for their potential to
impact accounting, auditing, and finance. In particular, the evolution of Decentralized Finance
(DeFi) has generated systematic reviews (Y. Chen & Bellavitis, 2020; Cousaert et al., 2022;
Gramlich et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023) examining blockchain’s potential to reduce financial
intermediation. This potential is exemplified through lending protocols (Xu & Vadgama, 2022),
stablecoins (Ante et al., 2023), and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) (Xu et al., 2023), which
operate via smart contracts (Adams et al., 2021) or at the protocol level of a blockchain (Her-
nandez Cruz et al., 2025; Peduzzi et al., 2021). In particular, stablecoins (Ante et al., 2023)
serve as the critical infrastructure bridging Traditional Finance (TradFi) and DeFi, though this
interconnection can propagate market shocks between both (Hernandez Cruz et al., 2024).

Dataset construction and analysis approach. Ontologies, specifically hierarchical taxonomies,
are pivotal in developing NER datasets for text mining (Alsheikh et al., 2022; Chang et al.,
2016; Huang et al., 2020; Mcentire et al., 2016; Nabi et al., 2022; Spasic et al., 2005). For
example, the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003), a NER dataset from 2,000 biological abstracts,
employs the GENIA ontology’s hierarchical tree structure of 47 biological entities, including top-
level categories such as biological source and substance to facilitate text mining in biomedical
literature. Similarly, the Human Phenotype Ontology is used to create and expand NER datasets
in biomedicine (Huang et al., 2020; Lobo et al., 2017). Alsheikh et al. (2022), Chang et al.

(2016), and Mcentire et al. (2016) further demonstrate the use of ontology-based NER datasets
for domain-specific literature text mining.

Learning from these biomedical field precedents, our methodology (Fig. 1) for NLP-based
text mining and filtering (Fig. 2) in the DLT field employs a hierarchical taxonomy (Tasca &
Tessone, 2017) to manually annotate a NER dataset of 80 full-text papers: 46 systematically
reviewed publications of DLT’s sustainability (Eigelshoven et al., 2020) and 34 manually selected
for their relevance to the ESG/DLT theme.

Two-tier analysis strategy. Our analysis followed a two-tier approach to maximize the use of
available data:

1. Broad analysis using metadata: Keyword extraction (Rose et al., 2021) and topic model-
ing (Asmussen & Mgller, 2019) provide a broad view of the main themes for a literature review.
We analyzed the complete corpus of over 60,000 papers using their metadata (e.g., titles and key-
words), regardless of full-text availability. This approach allows us to construct a comprehensive
keywords graph that captures the broad evolution of the DLT field. While many papers (38,413)
were behind paywalls or otherwise not easily accessible, their metadata still contributes to our
understanding of the field’s development.

2. Deep analysis using full text. We conducted a more detailed analysis of the subset
of 24,539 papers where full text was available through open-access journals, conferences, or
public repositories. We narrowed the number of publications for our analysis by fine-tuning a
transformer-based language model for a NER task for ESG/DLT content density corpus filtering.
This method allows us to categorize technologies in DLT, such as different Consensus mecha-
nisms (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) and their ESG implications, like “energy consump-
tion” and “computational power”, that would not usually emerge as single topics or keywords
for a literature review. This deeper analysis reveals nuanced connections that may not arise from
metadata alone.

Temporal graph and named entities analysis. The final stage involves a temporal graph and
named entities analysis to track the evolution of DLT technologies and their ESG implications
over time. This combines insights from the broad metadata analysis and the detailed full-text
examination, providing a comprehensive view of the field’s development.


3.1. Data collection

We constructed a directed citation network using a two-level expansion method: beginning
with seed papers, collecting their references, and then gathering the references of those refer-
ences. This two-level restriction helps maintain a thematic focus on ESG/DLT. The resulting
network comprises 63,083 publications. Through Semantic Scholar’s metadata for each publi-
cation (see Fig. 1), we retrieved 24,539 full-text PDFs that are openly accessible through open-
access journals, institutional repositories, preprint servers (e.g., arxiv), or publisher websites (see
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).

The key benefit of using seed papers to build a citation network for a systematic literature
review is the ease of expanding and updating the literature review by selecting seminal publi-
cations from the academic literature. The seed papers for our directed citation network were
selected from two sources:

1. 89 papers from (Eigelshoven et al., 2020), reviewing sustainability in popular DLT con-
sensus algorithms.

2. 17 publications (2018-2022) with at least three citations each, chosen to update the corpus
with more current research relevant to the ESG/DLT intersection (Alofi et al., 2022; Ante
& Fiedler, 2021; Bada et al., 2021; Cole & Cheng, 2018; Denisova et al., 2019; Eshani
et al., 2021; Fernando & Saravannan, 2021; Ghosh & Das, 2020; Kohli et al., 2022; Lucey
et al., 2021; Masood & Faridi, 2018; Platt et al., 2021; Powell et al., 2021; Sapkota &
Grobys, 2020; Schinckus et al., 2020; Sedlmeir et al., 2020, 2021).

3.2. NER task for literature mining

We considered using Large Language Models (LLMs) for our NER task. An unsupervised
approach like zero-shot NER with LLMs would have been more cost-effective in not requiring
manually labeled data. However, at the time of this writing, domain-specific NER tasks often
perform better with supervised learning models than with current LLMs (Hu et al., 2024; Li
et al., 2023). This performance difference arises from fundamental architectural distinctions:
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based models generally out-
perform decoder-only LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google Deepmind’s Gemini, on
token-level tasks like NER, due to their bidirectional encoder architecture (Devlin et al., 2019).
Specifically, BERT processes text by simultaneously considering both left and right context (De-
vlin et al., 2019), enabling it to capture fine-grained contextual information around each token.
This is a crucial capability for NER, where entity recognition often depends on the complete
contextual surrounding of a word.

In contrast, decoder-only architectures, like Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), pro-
cess text unidirectionally (left to right) (Radford & Narasimhan, 2018; Radford et al., 2019),
limiting their ability to capture the complete contextual information necessary for accurate en-
tity recognition. While decoder-only architectures excel at open-ended question answering, they
struggle to match BERT-based models’ NER performance (Hu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023),
which currently represents the state of the art for NER tasks”. Therefore, we adopted a super-
vised learning approach, fine-tuning and benchmarking several BERT-base models, selecting the
final model based on its performance and efficiency at inference. This approach provides more

granularity for literature mining an entire publication body without the hallucination issues of
LLMs (i.e., creation of irrelevant or inconsistent content). However, the trade-off is the require-
ment for the costly manual labeling of the NER dataset.

We manually annotated 80 publicly available publications using the brat tool (Stenetorp
et al., 2012) and argilla*, following the extended taxonomy framework of Tasca and Tessone
(2017) (Fig. 3). This taxonomy provides a hierarchical structure of DLT technology compo-
nents, with each principal component (e.g., Consensus) divided into sub-components (e.g.,
Gossiping) and further into sub-sub-components if needed (e.g., Local). We introduced cat-
egories like Blockchain Name to identify specific blockchains. We expanded the initial defi-
nition of Security Privacy to label security threats (e.g., Sybil attack and 51% attack).
Also, we added the Miscellaneous category for ambiguous contexts (see Fig. 3 and Table 1),
following the example of the CoNLL-2003 dataset for a similar category (Tjong et al., 2003). We
further extended Tasca and Tessone (2017)’s taxonomy to identify sustainability-related concepts
referred to in the ESG criterion (see Fig. 3).

taxonomy components (Fig. 3). To improve the NER model performance, which is sensitive to
label consistency (Jeong & Kang, 2023; Zeng et al., 2021), we employed a systematic process
for enhancing inter-labeler consistency. This process involved correcting inconsistent labeling of
entities. For example, “Sybil attack” was sometimes labeled as Consensus and, at other times,
as Security Privacy. We resolved this inconsistency following each labeler’s approval and
using programmatic cleaning to ensure consistency for non-context-dependent labels. For “Sybil
attack” specifically, we decided to label it as Security Privacy.

We applied text resampling for overlapping named entities that could fit into multiple cate-
gories, such as belonging to Blockchain Name and Native Currency Tokenization. This
process involves duplicating text and assigning distinct entities to each copy, enhancing the cap-
ture of rare entities. This resampling strategy is beneficial, especially for datasets of modest
size (Wang & Wang, 2022), improving model performance by accommodating diverse entity
categories. Additionally, the duplication of training data enhances a language model’s ability to
learn from limited examples (Charton & Kempe, 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2023).

3.2.3. Dataset filtering

We applied a percentile-based filtering process to the corpus of publications based on the
ESG and DLT classified named entities within the corpus. This method selects publications with
substantial DLT and ESG content, using a threshold percentile to exclude marginally relevant pa-
pers. Seed papers were included to maintain foundational references. The filtering is represented
as:

F = {P; : N(Pi) = percy;g(N(P))} A {Pi : Dpotr(Pi) = percog} NM {Pi : Desg(Pi) = perczp} U S
(1)
where F is the final set of papers, P; is an individual paper, N(P;) represents the total to-
ken count for paper i (with a minimum threshold at the 10" percentile to exclude potentially
corrupted or incomplete documents), Dpz7(P;) and Desc(P;) are the DLT and ESG content den-
sities respectively, and S is the set of seed papers. We define the percentile cut-offs for the DLT
and ESG content densities by manually reviewing the ratio of NER labeled tokens to all tokens
in the dataset.
Our processing, filtering, and selection methodology involved (see Fig. 2):

1. Processing: Excluding papers below the 10" percentile (N(P;) = perc, (N(P))) in the total
token count as a quality control mechanism, eliminating documents that may have been
improperly processed during PDF-to-text conversion or are too brief to contain meaningful
analysis (e.g., below 100 tokens). We named these discarded papers as “parsing errors” in
Fig. 2.

2. DLT content filter (Dpzr(Pi) = percgy): Computing DLT content density and retaining
papers above the 90" percentile, ensuring a strong focus on DLT topics.

3. Filtering for at least the 70" percentile in ESG content density to confirm relevance to ESG
(Desc(Pi) 2 perc).

Finally, we manually reviewed the selected filtered publications to validate the accuracy of
their ESG/DLT content density and relevance.


3.3. Network graphs and entities evolution

Keywords network. We constructed a graph Gkeywords(Vkeywords» E keywords) based on the full cor-
pus of over 60,000 metadata records, with vertices Vyeywords a8 individual keywords and edges
Exeywords tepresenting keywords co-occurrence within the same paper. We analyzed degree cen-
trality with one-year rolling windows to observe the evolution and significance of specific key-
words over time, providing insights into how research from these keywords representing topics
was foundational for the DLT field and facilitated the emergence of innovations.

ESG/DLT network. We analyzed the ESG/DLT content density filtered citation network as G(V, E),
with papers as vertices V and citations as edges E. We performed temporal graph analysis using
one-year time windows W,, W2,..., Wn, following the rolling window approach from Hoadley
et al. (2021), Steer et al. (2024), and Steer et al. (2020). For each window Wj, we created a
subgraph G;(V;, E;) and analyzed nodes, edges, average degree, and authority scores (using the
HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 2011)) to determine temporal shifts and how publications rely on
pivotal or existing work.

Entity analysis. We tracked the evolution of named entities in the ESG/DLT content density
filtered citation network, consolidating variations of similar entities (e.g., unifying all forms of
“Proof of Work” under “PoW”’) using lemmatization and programmatic grouping to accurately
capture changes in entity prevalence.

4.2. NER task result

We fine-tuned four pre-trained transformer models: the BERT base model (cased)>, which
uses a bidirectional encoder architecture (Devlin et al., 2019) (see §3.2 for more details); AL-
BERT base model v2°, a lighter version of BERT with a cross-layer parameter sharing technique
(Lan et al., 2019); DistiIBERT base model (cased)’, a distilled version of BERT (Sanh et al.,
2019); and SciBERT base model (cased)*, a BERT-based model pre-tained on a corpus of scien-
tific publications (Beltagy et al., 2019). To ensure robust evaluation and prevent data leakage, we
employed 5-fold cross-validation based on publication titles, ensuring that data from any single
publication appeared exclusively in the training or test set for each fold. The training process
consisted of 200 total epochs, distributed as 40 epochs per fold, with a learning rate of 5 x 10>,
a training batch size of 32, and a validation batch size of 64. The maximum sequence length was
512 tokens.

4An entity is counted from its beginning (“B-”) to its end (“I-”) using the IOB2 format (Tjong et al., 1999). See

The performance evaluation (Table 4) revealed that SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019) achieved
the highest Fl score for our domain-specific NER task in DLT. This aligns with expectations,
given SciBERT’s pre-training on a large multi-domain corpus of scientific literature, which im-
proves its performance in downstream scientific NLP tasks (Beltagy et al., 2019) like ours. De-
spite SciBERT’s results, we ultimately chose DistiIBERT, the second-best-performing model
(Table 4), for processing our large dataset of 24,539 publications. DistilBERT offers a reasonable
balance of effectiveness and efficiency, operating 60% faster than BERT, and likewise SciBERT,
during inference while retaining 97% of BERT’s performance (Sanh et al., 2019). This speed
and F1 score combination made DistilIBERT the most suitable choice for our large-scale analysis
of DLT literature.

5. Discussion

5.1. Transferability and adaptability of the methodology

5.1.1. Methodology framework transferability

Our methodology shows versatility in analyzing emerging technologies and their interdisci-
plinary implications. While we applied it to DLT? and ESG, the framework’s structure makes it
adaptable to various technological domains and their intersections, such as AI in healthcare or
renewable energy applications in urban development, to name a few.

Methodological framework. The methodology comprises five phases (Fig. 1). Initially, we es-
tablished a comprehensive corpus through data collection by selecting seed papers that represent
seminal publications at domain intersections of interest via citation analysis and expert con-
sultation, then systematically expanding this by traversal up to two levels of the seed paper’s
references (§3.1). The second phase focused on data labeling by first developing taxonomies that
capture the domain intersections terminology, which serves as a guideline for labeling a NER
dataset ($3.2.1 and §3.2.2). This labeled dataset then supported the third phase in which it is
used to fine-tune BERT-based models for a NER task (§3.2), benchmarking and selecting the
best-performing model ($4.2). The fourth phase applied the selected fine-tuned model to filter
the corpus based on the named entities identified (§3.2.3). Finally, we conducted a manual liter-
ature review and temporal graph analysis to derive insights that track the evolution of concepts,
technologies, and their interconnections.

Framework application example. To demonstrate the framework’s transferability, consider its
application to AI in healthcare research. The process would begin by identifying influential
papers at the Al-healthcare intersection, followed by traversal of the references from these papers
to build a comprehensive corpus. A specialized taxonomy would integrate medical terminology
with AI concepts, enabling dataset labeling for model fine-tuning. This fine-tuned model with
the labeled dataset would then facilitate the identification of specific medical AI technologies
and their clinical applications. Finally, a manual literature review using temporal graph analysis,
named entities, and citation network analysis would reveal the evolution of medical AI research
and its healthcare impact.

5.1.2. Methodological advantages over other approaches

Our methodology (§3) of using NER for field-specific literature filtering is similar to recent
LLM developments, such as Google DeepMind Gemini’s demonstration of a systematic literature
review. In Gemini’s approach, terms like “Chip” and “CRISPR-Cas9” are searched in publica-
tion titles and abstracts to filter results'®. This parallel highlights the significance of our work.
However, Gemini faces limitations like potential hallucinations that could undermine it for NER
tasks and filtering of publications. Although supervised learning approaches outperform current
LLMs for NER tasks (Hu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023), Gemini shows the potential of LLMs in
few-shot learning for NER tasks.

In contrast to current LLM approaches, our methodology (§3) uses a domain-specific labeled
NER dataset and a fine-tuned pre-trained language model to analyze full-text publications. This

supervised learning approach provides a more structured and verifiable framework for literature
analysis, making it particularly valuable for systematically examining emerging technical fields
and their intersections with other domains. The methodology’s emphasis on supervised learning
and domain-specific training ensures greater accuracy and reliability (see $3.2 for more details)
in literature review tasks while maintaining adaptability to various fields of study.

Figure 4: Evolution of research topics in the keywords graph from the full corpus of 63,096 publications.

The keywords graph comprises 25,048 topics as nodes with 3,042,397 edges and 4,847,870
temporal edges connecting the topics across time. Fig. 4 visually and quantitatively shows the
evolution of the key areas like Cryptography, Peer-to-Peer, PoW, PoS, and smart contracts that
laid the foundation for advancements in DLT at different points in time. The research in Cryptog-
raphy provided the foundations for using public and private key pairs for identity management
(D. L. Chaum, 1981), elliptic curves (Miller, 1986), hashing, and Merkle trees (Merkle, 1980).
Similarly, Peer-to-Peer research focused on network communication (Cohen, 2003; Dingledine
et al., 2004), timestamping (Bayer et al., 1993; Haber & Stornetta, 1991; Massias et al., 1999),
and the need for solving the Byzantine Generals Problem (Lamport et al., 1982), vital for de-
centralized network functionality. The research related to Proof of Work delineated the first
consensus system used in Blockchain building in the works from the early 1990s of Dwork and
Naor (1993) and the early 2000s of Back (2002) and Finney (2004).

The emergence of Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008) marked a significant convergence of these tech-
nologies. Its degree centrality as a research topic rapidly soared from 0.056 in the late 2010s to
1 in the 2020s, a growth of ~1,692.42%. This surge in interest, possibly fueled by the socio-
economic and political climate following the 2008 financial crisis (David Yaffe-Bellany, 2023;
Gautam Mukunda, 2018; Schepisi et al., 2021; Zamani & Babatsikos, 2017; Zewde & Crystal,
2022) and Bitcoin’s technological innovation, contrasted with digital money projects (D. Chaum,
1996; W. Dai, 1998; Szabo, 2005) in the 1990s and early 2000s that did not become as popular
as Bitcoin in the same amount of time.

Parallel to Bitcoin’s rise, or inspired by it (Cornish, 2018), Ethereum emerged around 2014-
2015, introducing two key technological innovations: the Solidity programming language and
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for smart contract development and execution, respec-
tively (Buterin, 2014a). Ethereum’s significance in the field grew substantially, with its degree

14


centrality increasing from 0.088 in 2014 to 0.419 in 2020s (a ~376.64% growth). While smart
contracts were conceptualized in the mid-1990s (Szabo, 1997), their adoption remained limited
until Ethereum’s implementation (Buterin, 2014a), which provided a comprehensive develop-
ment and execution environment through Solidity and the EVM. This technological foundation
catalyzed extraordinary growth in smart contract research interest, evidenced by a degree cen-
trality increase from 0.011 in the mid-1990s to 0.472 in the 2020s (a ~4,299.04% growth). This
research interest in smart contracts is reflected in efforts to extend its applicability, including le-
gal aspects through Smart Legal Contracts (Roche et al., 2021) and their generation using NLP
(E. Chen et al., 2023).

Amid these developments, Proof of Stake was introduced as an energy-efficient alternative
to Proof of Work by King and Nadal (2012) in 2012, which grew from 0.017-degree centrality
since its introduction to 0.152 in the 2020s, a ~768.68% growth, reflecting the growing interest
in more sustainable consensus mechanisms.

5.2.2. ESG/DLT network

The ESG/DLT content density citation graph, derived from 505 papers, comprises 10,172
nodes (each node representing a citation), 15,898 edges, and 20,111 temporal edges connecting
the publications over time. This graph facilitates narrowing down the publications specific to the
ESG/DLT intersection (see Fig. 2 and §3.2.3). The ESG/DLT network (Fig. 5a) reveals a distinc-
tive pattern in research evolution, particularly evident in the second layer of references, where
multidisciplinary research demonstrates increased prevalence (Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b). This layer
exhibits a notable concentration of ESG-focused investigations, especially regarding energy con-
sumption and efficiency optimization of blockchain systems (Fig. 5b). The peripheral references
display an even broader interdisciplinary scope, which extends beyond traditional computer sci-
ence boundaries into domains such as finance and environmental studies. This is likely because,
as the DLT field develops, interdisciplinary research emerges.

Figure 7: Named entities evolution in the citation network.

The network (Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b) shows a publication surge between 2008 and 2011 of
~191.03%, aligning with Bitcoin’s release and its subsequent influence on diverse DLT research
areas, particularly in consensus mechanisms (Fig. 7a!!). Notably, Bitcoin’s persistent and in-
creasing significance in research attention (see also §5.2.1), despite the emergence of alternative
solutions, demonstrates a “Lindy effect” (Goldman, 1964; Mandelbrot, 1983), where the proto-
col’s longevity correlates with its continued academic interest. As Bitcoin gained more public
attention after its appearance in 2008, often driven by price action, the research community eval-
uated this new technology, particularly Bitcoin’s PoW (Biryukov & Pustogarov, 2015; Vukoli¢,
2016), for potential unaccounted environmental costs (de Vries, 2018; Mora et al., 2018) or
negative externalities (Jones et al., 2022; Papp et al., 2023).

Despite Bitcoin’s prominent media coverage regarding energy consumption, our analysis of
the ESG/DLT citation network (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7a) reveals two significant patterns in research

'lThe Blockchain Name entities identified before 2007, such as HashCash (Back, 2002), reflect the standard industry
practice of using “Blockchain” as a generic term for any consensus-based DLT system, a convention we maintain in our
taxonomic classification.

focus. First, ESG-related research has maintained a consistent proportional representation within
the broader DLT literature rather than showing increased relative dominance (Fig. 7a), with its
primary focus remaining on energy consumption and efficiency optimization of blockchain sys-
tems (Fig. 5b). Second, the research emphasis has evolved from an early focus on fundamental
security and privacy considerations (§5.2.1) toward a growing focus on efficient (King & Nadal,
2012) and secure consensus algorithms (Douceur, 2002), and blockchain architectures (Bonneau
et al., 2015; Vukoli¢é, 2016). Curiously, we observe an increase in these studies investigating
energy-efficient consensus mechanisms and scaling solutions during periods of rapid price ap-
preciation, such as Bitcoin’s bull runs (Canellis, 2023; Kucoin, 2024; Lang, 2024).

Post-2012, the network saw a marked increase in publications, especially after 2014, re-
flecting the impact of seminal works like PPCoin and Ethereum’s whitepapers (Buterin, 2014a;
King & Nadal, 2012). The growth in citations and publications from 2012 until the 2020s was
~901.75%. The increased interest in PoS as an energy-efficient alternative to PoW (Perez et al.,
2020) is exemplified by Vitalik Buterin’s early exploration of PoS before Ethereum’s launch us-
ing PoW in 2015, which is evident in his 2014 Slasher algorithm post (Buterin, 2014d) and later
posts that discuss PoS benefits (Buterin, 2014b), and the “nothing at stake” challenge (Buterin,
2014c).

Vitalik’s early public discussions of PoS may have been one of the catalysts that encouraged
further research into PoS (Fig. 4 and Fig. 7b) before Ethereum’s transition from PoW to PoS
in 2022 (Ethereum Foundation, 2022). This is consistent with how Ethereum popularized smart
contracts despite the research around smart contracts existing since the mid-1990s (Szabo, 1997),
but remaining seemingly static as a topic of interest for the research community (Fig. 4) until after
Ethereum introduced the Solidity programming language and EVM (85.2.1 and Fig. 4).

DLT’s thematic shift, coupled with the increasing prominence of terms like “decentraliza-
tion”, “blockchain’”, and “sustainability”, underscores a multidisciplinary approach in the field
(Fig. 7c). The sustained interest in PoW, along with explorations into PoS and other consen-
sus mechanisms, highlights the field’s adaptability to environmental and scalability challenges
(Fig. 7b).

5.3. Limitations

Our literature review faces limitations, including potential biases in seed paper selection
and a time lag in capturing recent publications, which may affect the comprehensiveness of
our analysis. For instance, the choice of XRP’s 2018 whitepaper (Chase & MacBrough, 2018)
over the more cited 2014 edition (Schwartz et al., 2014) could underestimate its influence on
the citation network. Similarly, recent works such as the 2018 Hedera whitepaper (Baird et al.,
2018) are omitted due to unavailable citation data.

Building the citation network predominantly from pre-2020 seed papers introduces a bias
toward older publications, potentially overlooking newer research yet to achieve recognition
(Fig. 6a). While our methodology could theoretically filter citations to seed papers based on
content density, our review focused solely on references within the seed papers, possibly limit-
ing the thematic breadth.

Regarding our NER dataset performance, there is an expected noise level (Alfina et al., 2017;
Fetahu et al., 2023; Rucker & Akbik, 2023) that we tried to reduce by enforcing interlabeler
consistency (see §3.2.2). Our dataset, with 80 full-text manually labeled papers, is smaller than
many general-purpose NER datasets (Loukas et al., 2022; Tedeschi et al., 2021; Tjong et al.,
2003; Weischedel et al., 2017) but is comparable to those in specialized domains like materials
science (Cheung et al., 2024; Dagdelen et al., 2024).

17


Our analysis contains 24,539 openly accessible publications from an initial corpus of 63,083
references (Fig. 2). While this reliance on publicly available research introduces potential sam-
pling limitations, several factors mitigate concerns about representativeness and comprehensive-
ness. First, empirical evidence demonstrates that open-access publications achieve broader aca-
demic engagement (Archambault et al., 2014; McCabe & Snyder, 2014; Piwowar et al., 2018)
and higher media attention (Schultz, 2021), suggesting they effectively capture significant re-
search developments and may influence more research trends. Second, although only approxi-
mately 18% of journal articles are currently openly available (Piwowar et al., 2018), high-quality
research authors increasingly seem to favor hybrid open-access journals (Gaulé & Maystre,
2011). Third, the DLT field’s rapid evolution has elevated non-traditional literature, particularly
whitepapers and industry publications, as crucial sources of technological developments. Sem-
inal works such as the whitepapers for Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008), Ethereum (Buterin, 2014a),
and PPCoin (King & Nadal, 2012) exemplify this trend. Our methodology addresses these con-
siderations through two complementary approaches: (1) incorporating non-traditional academic
literature to capture contemporary technological developments, and (2) leveraging metadata from
paywalled publications in our broader analysis of the DLT field evolution (§5.2.1). This two-tier
analytical approach (§3) ensures comprehensive coverage of DLT research developments while
maintaining methodological rigor.

5.4. Future work

Future work, as outlined in §5.3, should focus on integrating metadata from different whitepa-
per versions, like XRP’s 2014 and 2018 editions (Chase & MacBrough, 2018; Schwartz et al.,
2014), and sourcing metadata from alternative databases for publications with missing informa-
tion, such as Hedera’s whitepaper (Baird et al., 2018). Additional research should also include
regular updates to the taxonomy (refer to Table 1), expanding training data by annotating more
seed papers and exploring various language model architectures.

Additionally, beyond the systematic literature review presented in this paper, our NER dataset
could also support other cross-domain literature review research, such as DLT applications across
software development, cybersecurity, and governance frameworks. Also, it could enable relation-
ship mapping between DLT concepts, supporting the construction of knowledge graphs. Finally,
the dataset could contribute to developing automated systematic literature review systems, partic-
ularly valuable given the rapid evolution of the DLT field. These potential applications emphasize
our NER dataset’s versatility and value beyond this paper.

6. Conclusion

This paper addresses the scarcity of high-quality labeled NLP data for blockchain research
by developing an NER dataset for the ESG/DLT domains intersection from public sources. We
conducted a systematic literature review analysis to demonstrate its utility and provide future
research possibilities. Our analysis reveals the critical intersections of topics like Cryptography,
Peer-to-Peer, Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and smart contracts in the evolution of DLT. We
observed Bitcoin’s persistent dominance in research (a “Lindy effect”). Ethereum’s significant
impact on the adoption of smart contracts and PoS as an energy-efficient alternative to PoW.
These insights, and the growing focus on energy-efficient consensus mechanisms, highlight the
field’s rapid adaptation to technological and environmental challenges.

18


We believe our work represents a step towards leveraging and facilitating the use of NLP
to research rapidly evolving fields like DLT, enabling researchers, policymakers, and industry
stakeholders to stay informed and make data-driven decisions.
