Abstract

There are a lot of tools and resources
available for processing Finnish. In
this paper, we survey recent papers
focusing on Finnish NLP related to
many different subcategories of NLP
such as parsing, generation, semantics
and speech. NLP research is conducted
in many different research groups in
Finland, and it is frequently the case
that NLP tools and models resulting
from academic research are made avail-
able for others to use on platforms such
as Github.

1 Introduction

There is no doubt that, within the Uralic lan-
guage family, Finnish is one of the most well-
resourced languages in terms of natural lan-
guage processing (NLP). This has, however,
not always been the case. Currently, NLP re-
search conducted for Finnish has started to

fragment into research outputs of several dif-
ferent research groups, and there is no survey
paper out there that would describe the cur-
rent state of Finnish NLP.

We hope that this survey paper clarifies the
current situation and makes it clearer for peo-
ple working in the academia outside of Finnish
universities or in the industry and also for
students. As it has been discussed before
(Hamalainen, 2021), Finnish is certainly not a
low-resourced language, and our current sur-
vey further proves this point.

It is also important for researchers working
on other smaller Uralic languages to see what
has been done for Finnish in terms of NLP to
see what the possible and meaningful direc-
tions are for further developing the resources
needed. Especially since Uralic language share
the same feature of rich morphology, which is
something that commonly causes problems for
computers.

2 Finnish NLP

In this section, we present a survey on the
current state of Finnish NLP. We have tried
to gather most of the current research on the
topic, but we are certain that there are some
research out there we have not been able to
find. We have categorized the surveyed re-
search outputs into parsing, generation, se-
mantics and speech.

2.1 Parsing

Starting from morphology, stemming and spell
checking Finnish is well supported in multiple
commercial applications such as Microsoft and
Google products. In the open-source world,
low-level tasks such as stemming and spell


checking can be conducted with Voikko!.

Omorfi (Pirinen, 2015)? is currently the
most well supported tool for morphological
analysis (including lemmatization) and gener-
ation. It is an FST (finite-state transducer)
based tool developed on HFST (Helsinki finite-
state technology) (Lindén et al., 2013) and it
works together with constraint grammar (CG)
based disambiguators and syntactic parsers
available in the Giellatekno (Moshagen et al.,
2014) repositories®.

FinnPos* (Silfverberg et al., 2016) is an-
other morphological tagger and lemmatizer
tool based on CRF (conditional random
field). There have been recently more
data driven approaches focusing on Finnish
(Silfverberg and Hulden, 2018).

While rule-based tradition has been strong
in the past®, there are several machine learn-
ing driven dependency parsers for Finnish,
such as the statistical one® (Haverinen et al.,
2014) and neural one’ (Kanerva et al., 2018)
by TurkuNLP.

Out of the aforementioned tools Omorfi
(and the CG disambigator) and the machine
learning based parsers are available to use
through a Python package named UralicNLP®
9 (Hamalainen, 2019).

As Finnish data is available in sev-
eral multilingual datasets, there are
many multilingual approaches for parsing
(Qi et al., 2020)'° (Honnibal et al., 2020)"
and morphology (Aharoni and Goldberg,
2017; Nicolai and Yarowsky, 2019;
Silfverberg and Tyers, 2019; Gronroos et al.,
2020).

The fact that spoken Finnish is very dif-
ferent to standard Finnish has drawn some
attention in the past (Jauhiainen, 2001) and

pipeline/

recently (Partanen et al., 2019). The latter
leading to a Python library called Murre!? for
automatic normalization of dialectal Finnish.

Non-standard data has been an issue in dig-
ital humanities (DH) projects (Makela et al.,
2020), and lately there have been ef-
forts in automatically correcting OCR. er-
rors in existing historical datasets (Kettunen,
2015; Drobac and Lindén, 2020; Drobac, 2020;
Duong et al., 2020).

Named entity recognition has also been
under study with FiNER! and its. re
cently released data (Ruokolainen et al.,
2019). There is also another recent BERT
(Devlin et al., 2019) based approach! to the
topic (Luoma et al., 2020).

There have been several approaches to lan-
guage detection including detection of Finnish
from web corpora (see Jauhiainen et al.,
2021). Similarly, native Finnish has been au-
tomatically identified from learner’s Finnish
(Malmasi and Dras, 2014).

In summary, parsing has been researched
on different levels of language such as syn-
tax, morphology, POS and NER tagging, and
lemmatization. It has been mainly focusing on
standard well-formed Finnish, although there
are methods for coping with dialectal Finnish
and OCR errors as well.

2.2 Generation

The lowest level of natural language genera-
tion is surface realization (see Reiter, 1994),
and for that there are tools such as Omorfi
and Syntax Maker!® (HamAldinen and Rueter,
2018). The latter uses Omorfi for morphologi-
cal inflection while it takes care of higher level
morphosyntax such as case government and
agreement.

There is a strong computational creativity
focus in Helsinki and it also shows in Finnish
NLG, as there are several poem generators
such as Keinoleino!® (Hamalainen, 2018b),
Poeticus (Toivanen et al., 2012) and others
(Hamélainen and Alnajjar, 2019a,b). There is
also an interactive poem generator tool called

https: //github.com/mikahama/syntaxmaker
https: //github.com/mikahama/keinoleino


Runokone (Poem Machine)!’ (Hamélainen,
2018c).

Recently there have been
eral approaches to enhancing existing
news headlines (Alnajjar et al., 2019;
Ramo and Leppanen, 2021). And some
approaches to generating entire news ar-
ticles automatically (Kanerva et al., 2019;
Haapanen and Leppanen, 2020).

Paraphrase generation  (Sjoblom et al.,
2020) has also become a researched topic
with the availability of monolingually aligned
parallel corpora (Creutz, 2018). There is also
an approach to converting standard Finnish
text into different dialects (HamAalainen et al.,
2020).

Finnish is a typical language for machine
translation tasks and it is not uncommon to
see it featured in several papers that deal
with multiple languages. However, there
are several papers that focus on Finnish in
particular (Hurskainen and Tiedemann, 2017;
Hamalainen and Alnajjar, 2019c;  Pirinen,
2019a; Tiedemann et al., 2020).

There is also a recent approach to dia-
log generation in Finnish (Leino et al., 2020).
Also non-native language learner’s errors
have been corrected successfully automatically
(Creutz and Sjoblom, 2019).

To summarize the approaches, there are sev-
eral generators for poetry and news that ben-
efit from the available surface realizers. Para-
phrasing, dialect adaptation, dialog genera-
tion and learners’ error correction are domains
with some research with potential for new
discoveries in the future. Machine transla-
tion gets frequently attention from different re-
searchers. There are several more NLG tasks
(see Gatt and Krahmer 2018) that have not
been researched at all in Finnish, which means
that there is a lot of room for more research
on this topic.

Sev-

2.3. Semantics

Vector representations of meaning have be-
come common place in NLP and Finnish
is no exception with the availability of pre-
trained word2vec!® !° (Laippala and Ginter,

http: //runokone.cs.helsinki.fi/

'Shttp://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository /

https: //bionlp.utu.fi/finnish-internet-
parsebank.html

2014; Kutuzov et al., 2017) and fastText??
(Bojanowski et al., 2017) models.

BERT models have also become avail-
able as part of the multilingual BERT
model?! (Devlin et al., 2019) or trained sepa-
rately for Finnish?? 7° (Kutuzov et al., 2017;
Virtanen et al., 2019). Even Elmo mod-
els have been made available for Finnish?+
(Uléar and Robnik-Sikonja, 2020).

In addition to the standard vector-based
representations of meaning, there is another
statistical model called SemFi?? (HamAlainen,
2018a). The model is a relational database
that captures semantic relations of words
based on their syntactic co-occurencies.

Before the era of machine learning, there
were two prominent projects for model-
ing meaning computationally which have
been translated into Finnish WordNet
(Lindén and Carlson, 2010) and FrameNet
(Lindén et al., 2019).

With the similar ideology to the hand
crafted resources, there have been several
different linked data projects in Finland
representing semantics in structured ontolo-
gies (Hyvonen et al., 2006; Nyrkk6, 2018;
Thomas et al., 2018; Koho et al., 2019). Many
of the linked data projects are available on the
Linked Data Finland website?®.

There is a Python library called FinMeter?’
(Hamélainen and Alnajjar, 2019b) that has
some higher level semantic tools for Finnish
such as metaphor interpretation, word con-
creteness analysis and sentiment analysis.
Sentiment analysis for Finnish has also
been studied later on?® (Ohman et al., 2020;
Vankka et al., 2019; Lindén et al., 2020).
There is also research on topic modeling
methods (Ginter et al., 2009; Hengchen et al.,
2018; Loukasmaki and Makkonen, 2019).

Finnish is well supported by traditional rep-
resentations of semantics and latest vector

based models. There is a vast amount of linked
data resources in a variety of domains. Higher-
level semantics such as metaphor interpreta-
tion and sentiment analysis also have received
their share of research interest, although there
are many more questions related to pragmatics
and figurative language that have not been re-
searched, such as sarcasm detection, multi-hop
reasoning and fake news detection to name a
few.

2.4 Speech

Apart from Finnish speech being supported by
companies, there are some open-source tools
that can synthesize Finnish. Festival?? has a
Finnish voice named Suopuhe®’, and eSpeak-
ng®! can even generate IPA characters for
Finnish.

There are several more modern approaches
to speech recognition (Enarvi et al., 2017;
Varjokallio et al., 2021) and speech synthesis
(Raitio et al., 2008, 2014). Although, speech
synthesis has not gained much interest in the
recent years.

There are several approaches to analyz-
ing speech prosody (Virkkunen et al., 2018;
Simko et al., 2020). There is also some
work on detecting different accents in spo-
ken Finnish (Behravan et al., 2013, 2015) and
named entity recognition (Porjazovski et al.,
2020).

In summary, several approaches exist for
speech processing in Finnish relating to recog-
nition, accents and prosody. However, speech
synthesis has received a surprisingly small
amount of attention in the recent past. With
the emergence of neural models, new research
on synthesis could reach to potentially inter-
esting new contributions.

3 Discussion and Conclusions

In this survey, we have gathered research con-
ducted on different aspects of NLP. We have
included links to models and code implemen-
tations for most of the research papers. It has
been a pleasant thing to notice that not only
Finnish NLP research exists but also it is often
not conducted in a closed fashion, but the ac-
tual research outputs have been made openly

available for a wider community of people even
outside of academia. This is crucial for any
language that is relatively small, like Finnish.
If Finnish academics did not release their re-
search, there would not be many other people
in the world that would produce high-quality
tools for Finnish.

Digital extinction is something that many
endangered languages are facing right now (see
Kornai 2013). Therefore, it is important to en-
sure that NLP resources become openly avail-
able for endangered Uralic languages as well.
Availability itself is not enough, however, as
the resources need to be easy to find and use.
Despite the fact that we have open NLP tools
for Finnish, we are still far a way from a
world where machines use our language flu-
ently. Finnair’s in-flight entertainment sys-
tem still announces happliy: *saavumme ko-
hteeseen Helsinki (*we arrive in destination
Helsinki) instead of expressing it correctly,
saavumme Helsinkiin (we arrive in Helsinki),
Google Doc’s spell checker does not recognize
mostly any inflectional form with a possessive
suffix and predictive text in mobile keyboards
suggest overly formal normative Finnish only.

While Finnish NLP has come far in terms of
academic research and tools built as a result,
we as a nation are still far away from having
Finnish language technology fully integrated
into the systems we use every day. Many of the
problems have been solved already, it is just
the matter of the industry finding out about
the NLP tools that are out there.

We have limited our survey to NLP tools
and methods only. We know that there are
a plethora of language resources available for
Finnish as well. Based on our experiences,
many corpora are well hidden and digging
them up is a time consuming effort worthy
of a separate survey paper. Unfortunately
the Finnish practice of describing data on
Metashare®” is very unhelpful in this respect
because the metadata descriptions in the ser-
vice hardly ever contain information about
where to access the data, how to cite it and
who the real authors are.
