Attention in Large Language Models

Abstract-This paper proposes a modeling framework for
dynamic topic evolution based on temporal large language models.
The method first uses a large language model to obtain contextual
embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay function
and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to
adjust the importance of semantic units according to time intervals
and capture topic variations across different periods. The temporal
representations are then mapped into a latent topic space, where a
state transition matrix is applied to describe the dynamic evolution
of topics. A joint optimization objective constrains both semantic
modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity and
smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified
modeling of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which
improves topic coherence and diversity while enhancing stability
and interpretability over time. Experiments on real-world corpora
show that the framework effectively captures the generation,
expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms existing models
across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides a
systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling,
and supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the information age, the scale and complexity of textual
data are growing at an unprecedented pace. A vast number of
news articles, academic papers, social media posts, and
industry reports are being produced every day. Extracting
valuable thematic structures from this data has become a
pressing challenge. Traditional topic modeling methods often
rely on static assumptions and fail to capture temporal
variations[1]. In reality, topics are not fixed but evolve with
changes in environment, policy, technology, and social
attention. In high-sensitivity domains such as finance,
healthcare, and public opinion monitoring, understanding how
topics emerge and fade over time is crucial for trend prediction
and decision support [2-4]. Building large language models
with temporal awareness for dynamic topic evolution is,
therefore, not only a natural direction of NLP development but
also of great social value and practical importance.

The rapid progress of large language models provides new
opportunities for topic modeling. These models have strong
representational power and can capture deep semantic
associations across context while learning complex knowledge
structures from large corpora[5]. However, when the temporal

dimension is ignored, static representations cannot reflect the
lifecycle of topics. Topics may emerge, expand, merge, or
decline at different stages, and these dynamic processes are
closely linked to time. Incorporating temporal mechanisms
allows models to go beyond simple word frequency and co-
occurrence, revealing more accurate semantic trajectories. This
improves topic discovery and also enables the study of long-
term trends, periodic fluctuations, and sudden events in text
data[6].

From a broader perspective, modeling dynamic topic
evolution is central to understanding the construction of human
knowledge systems. In scientific research, research hotspots
shift over time across disciplines, and capturing these changes
helps trace the development of scientific frontiers and
technological advances[7]. In public policy and governance,
evolving social issues reflect changes in public concern and
discourse, and modeling them supports policymaking and risk
monitoring. In industry and market analysis, the emergence and
transformation of business topics reflect changes in industrial
ecosystems and provide data-driven insights for corporate
strategy. Temporal topic modeling is thus not only a technical
task but also a key approach to interpreting the logic of social
dynamics in the information era.

At the same time, dynamic topic evolution involves a
deeper exploration of the relationship between language and
time. Language mirrors social activities, and the temporal
dimension endows textual data with continuity and historicity.
Shifts in semantic distributions across time windows essentially
reflect human cognition and social processes. Temporal large
language models can reveal both macro-level topic evolution
and micro-level semantic shifts[8]. This dual perspective
enables researchers to detect long-term developments while
also capturing subtle variations, leading to a more complete
understanding of dynamic semantic structures in text corpora.

Driven by both theoretical interest and practical application,
temporally large language models for dynamic topic evolution
have become an important interdisciplinary research direction.
They foster the integration of NLP, machine learning, and
time-series analysis, expanding the application boundaries of
large models in complex semantic spaces[9]. At the same time,
they provide powerful tools for intelligent analysis of real-
world problems, allowing massive text data to be interpreted
within temporal contexts. This enriches research paradigms in
text mining and brings higher-value insights to fields such as
social science, economics, and medicine. In other words,


temporal topic modeling not only addresses the challenges of
data complexity and dynamics but also strengthens the human
ability to understand and navigate the information world.

Il. RELATED WORK

Recent methodological progress in large language models
has significantly advanced the modeling of dynamic topic
evolution. One approach leverages structured path guidance to
enhance logical coherence in text generation, providing explicit
modeling of structural dependencies within language model
outputs. This strategy lays the groundwork for models that can
maintain semantic consistency across temporal sequences, a
critical feature for tracking evolving topics over time [10].

Building on the need for internal model consistency,
dynamic routing mechanisms have been proposed to facilitate
knowledge adaptation within large language models. By
introducing consistency constraints during dynamic routing,
these methods align internal representations and further
stabilize semantic patterns across different time periods. This
dynamic alignment complements the logic-driven structural
coherence discussed previously, jointly contributing to more
robust temporal modeling [11]. Structured reasoning
capabilities are also enhanced by integrating knowledge graphs
into the fine-tuning of language models. Through the infusion
of external knowledge structures, models can capture not only
sequential dependencies but also deeper relational patterns
between concepts. This methodological innovation improves
the interpretability and traceability of topic transitions as they
unfold over time, thereby enriching the consistency and logical
flow introduced by previous strategies [12].

Parameter efficiency is another key concern in the
adaptation of large language models. Structure-learnable
adapter fine-tuning enables flexible model updates by
introducing adapters capable of learning and_ transferring
structural knowledge from data. These adapters work
synergistically with knowledge-driven reasoning modules to
make model adaptation both computationally efficient and
structurally aware—a requirement for large-scale, time-
sensitive topic modeling [13]. Complementing adapter-based
approaches, joint structural pruning and parameter sharing aim
to optimize the use of model parameters by reducing
redundancy and preserving essential structures. This pruning
strategy not only lowers computational demands but also helps
maintain the semantic and temporal consistency established by
the aforementioned methodologies, allowing models to be
more easily fine-tuned for evolving topics [14].

A critical aspect of model trustworthiness is interpretability.
To address this, interpretable frameworks have been developed
for semantic and structural analysis, uncovering implicit biases
and latent relational structures within model representations.
These interpretable mechanisms enhance transparency, making
it easier to understand how language models process semantic
information and how such processing evolves with topic
dynamics, thereby supporting the broader goal of explainable
dynamic modeling [15]. While interpretability addresses
transparency, robustness to dynamic environments is tackled
through causal representation learning. By identifying and
disentangling causal factors, this technique allows models to
generalize better and remain stable even as underlying data

distributions shift. Such causal modeling naturally
complements interpretability by enabling the model to explain
not only what changes, but also why changes occur in evolving
topics [16]. Feature attention mechanisms combined with
temporal modeling further enhance the adaptability of language
models. By dynamically weighting features according to their
temporal relevance, these methods allow the model to more
precisely track changes in topic significance across different
periods. This capability integrates seamlessly with prior causal
and structural methodologies, resulting in a more holistic
framework for dynamic topic evolution [17]. As data privacy
and security have become increasingly important, privacy-
enhanced federated learning frameworks have been proposed
for distributed training. These methodologies employ secure
aggregation and differential privacy, enabling models to
collaboratively learn from distributed, heterogeneous data
while safeguarding sensitive information. Such _privacy-
preserving techniques expand the practical applicability of
dynamic topic modeling to multi-party settings without
sacrificing methodological rigor [18].

Scalable multi-party collaborative data mining builds on
federated learning principles by introducing robust
coordination and communication _ strategies. This
methodological extension ensures that temporal topic models
remain adaptable and up-to-date as they incorporate new data
sources and collaborative insights, directly supporting dynamic,
decentralized modeling scenarios [19]. To further protect
privacy during language model adaptation, selective fine-
tuning with semantic attention masks has been developed. This
approach regulates information flow, ensuring sensitive
semantic attributes are preserved while still allowing the model
to flexibly adapt its representations to changing topic
landscapes. This methodology aligns well with federated and
collaborative learning, maintaining both privacy and temporal
adaptability [20].

Finally, graph neural network and transformer integration
represent an emerging direction for capturing complex, non-
linear dependencies within textual data. By combining the
relational power of graphs with the contextual modeling
strength of transformers, this technique allows for unsupervised
discovery of both anomalies and evolving structures in large-
scale text. As such, it serves as a powerful complement to the
preceding methodologies, enhancing the capacity for fine-
grained and structural-aware topic evolution [21].

Together, these methodological advances form a
comprehensive foundation for unified modeling frameworks
that address semantic, structural, temporal, and privacy-related
challenges in dynamic topic evolution.

III. METHOD

In this study, we model dynamic topic evolution using a
time-aware large language model framework. First, to capture
the underlying representation of text in semantic space, we map
the input text sequence into context-sensitive embedding

vectors. Given a text sequence X = {X,,X5,...,X7} , its

embedding representation is obtained through the encoding
layer of the large language model:


H=fj(X)={Mylyy-shp}, he R®

Where /f, g represents the parameterized language model,

h, is the semantic vector of the t-th word, and d is the vector
dimension. This representation provides basic feature support
for subsequent topic identification and temporal modeling.

To capture the dynamic evolution of topics in the time
dimension, we introduce a time-aware attention mechanism.

For the text embedding h, at different moments, the

contribution in different time windows is weighted by an
explicit time decay factor, defined as:
iy

hTh,
exp g(Aty))
ij orp

a exp -g(At,))

Where At ,, Tepresents the time interval between two text

units, and g(-) is the time weight function, which can be

designed as an exponential decay form g(At)=e™ .

Through this mechanism, the model can highlight the role of
recent semantics while weakening the influence of remote
semantics, thereby achieving the coupling of topic modeling
and temporal characteristics. The overall model architecture is
shown in Figure 1.

In the topic distribution modeling stage, we map the time-
aware semantic representation to the latent topic space. Let the
latent topic set be Z = {Z., Zo yeong Zig} , then the topic
distribution of the i-th document can be expressed as:

6, =softmaxWh, +b), Qe R*

Where W and b are learnable parameters, and A is the
distribution vector of the i-th document on K_ topics.
Furthermore, considering the time evolution of the topic, we
use the state transition matrix to model the dynamic changes of
the topic over time:

Finally, to achieve the overall modeling of the topic
evolution path, we introduce a joint optimization objective to
unify semantic representation learning and time series
modeling in the same framework. The overall objective
function is defined as:

N K T-1

i=l k=l t=1

The first term is the log-likelihood loss based on the topic
distribution, the second term is the temporal consistency
constraint, and @ is the weight coefficient, which is used to

balance semantic representation and dynamic evolution
modeling. Through this objective function, the model not only
learns the static topic distribution but also captures the smooth
evolution and mutation characteristics of topics over time, thus
forming a comprehensive portrayal of dynamic topic evolution.

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

A. Dataset

This study draws upon the 20 Newsgroups dataset, a
widely-used resource in natural language processing. It
comprises articles from 20 diverse newsgroups, spanning
topics including society, science, technology, and
entertainment. The dataset undergoes a cleaning and grouping
process, which accentuates its rich thematic features while
preserving cross-domain distinctions. This setup serves as an
ideal experimental environment for modeling the dynamic
evolution of topics.

The dataset has a moderate sample size and shows clear
variation in both time and semantics. Although the texts
originate from newsgroup discussions, they include topics and
trends from different stages. This allows the data to simulate
the evolution of themes over time. It provides realistic support
for introducing temporal mechanisms into large language
models and helps to verify model performance in dynamic
scenarios.

In addition, the 20 Newsgroups dataset has been widely
applied in text mining and topic modeling tasks. It offers
strong comparability and high research value. Using this
dataset ensures reproducibility of experiments and allows
direct observation of how models capture topic evolution
under the same corpus. Through its in-depth use, the
applicability of temporal models in complex semantic
environments can be fully demonstrated.

B. Experimental Results

This paper first conducts a comparative experiment, and the
experimental results are shown in Table 1.

Traditional topic modeling methods show clear limitations
in dynamic contexts. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
produces high Perplexity and low Diversity and Topic
Coherence, indicating weak semantic consistency and poor
adaptation to topic changes over time. Pretrained language
model-based methods such as BERT and DeBERTa improve
Diversity and Coherence by capturing deep semantic relations,
but their Topic Stability remains low due to the lack of
temporal modeling. Newer approaches like topic audiolization
and the T3 model further enhance Coherence and Diversity yet
still fail to ensure smooth topic transitions. In contrast, the
proposed model achieves lower Perplexity, higher Diversity
and Coherence, and markedly better Topic Stability,
confirming the value of incorporating temporal mechanisms
for stable, semantically rich, and dynamically evolving topics.
A sensitivity analysis of hidden layer dimensionality on topic
consistency and diversity is also conducted, as shown in
Figure 2.

The results show that increasing the hidden layer
dimension improves topic coherence and diversity, with
notable gains from 128 to 768 dimensions. Higher-
dimensional representations better capture complex semantics,
making topics more coherent and diverse. However,
performance slightly declines at 1024 dimensions, suggesting
excessive dimensionality introduces noise. These findings
highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate dimension
to balance model capacity and efficiency. An additional
experiment on the impact of time series length on topic
smoothness and prediction performance is shown in Figure 3.

The experimental results show that with the increase of
sequence length, the model exhibits significant trends across
multiple evaluation metrics. Perplexity is high for short
sequences, but decreases as the sequence length grows and
reaches the lowest value around 200. This indicates that a
longer time span provides richer contextual information,
which improves the overall fitting ability. However, when the

sequence length continues to increase, Perplexity shows a
slight rebound. This suggests that overly long sequences may
introduce redundant information and increase modeling
complexity.

and forecasting performance

For the Diversity metric, topic diversity gradually
improves as the sequence length increases, reaching its peak at
medium lengths. This indicates that an appropriate time span
enables the model to capture more latent semantic patterns and
reduces redundancy or over-concentration of topics. Yet at
very long sequences, diversity slightly decreases. This
suggests that excessively long windows may impair the
model’s capacity to discern nuanced semantic distinctions. In
general, coherence improves as the sequence length increases,
indicating that longer contexts facilitate stronger correlations
among topic words and generate more coherent topics. The
optimal performance is observed around 200, where the model
strikes a balance between local consistency and global
representation. However, as the sequence length extends
further, coherence experiences a slight decline. This implies
that incorporating excessive historical information may dilute
the primary semantic signals.

Topic Stability improves steadily as the sequence length
grows, with the best stability achieved at longer sequences.
This demonstrates that temporal mechanisms can maintain
smooth and continuous topic evolution over extended time
spans, preventing fragmentation caused by short-term
fluctuations. Overall, the results confirm the critical influence
of sequence length on dynamic topic evolution modeling.
They also show that extending the sequence length within a
reasonable range significantly enhances both smoothness and
predictive performance.

V. CONCLUSION

This study focuses on dynamic topic evolution modeling
with temporal large language models. It addresses the
limitations of traditional methods in static semantic modeling
and the insufficient use of temporal information. An integrated
framework is proposed that captures both semantic depth and
temporal evolution. By introducing explicit temporal


perception into the corpus, the model better reflects the
generation, development, and decline of topics. This enhances
the quality and rationality of topic modeling. The study
provides new insights for dynamic semantic understanding and
builds a solid foundation for processing complex temporal text
data.

At the application level, the proposed framework has
significant value in multiple fields. In finance, dynamic topic
modeling can capture changes in market sentiment and industry
trends, supporting risk assessment and investment decisions. In
healthcare, analysis of literature and clinical records over time
can reveal research frontiers and clinical priorities. In social
governance and public security, monitoring the evolution of
news and social media topics enables rapid responses to
emergencies and public opinion shifts. These examples show
that temporal topic modeling has cross-domain applicability
and practical relevance.

The study also demonstrates the potential of large language
models in handling dynamic data. With temporal mechanisms,
the model maintains strong semantic representation while
improving sensitivity to temporal changes. This makes it useful
not only for academic knowledge tracking but also for
industrial applications such as information flow mining, trend
prediction, and intelligent decision-making. Moreover, the
framework shows strong scalability and can be extended to
multimodal data, enabling the modeling of more complex
information environments.

VI. FUTURE WORK

Future research may explore multi-dimensional temporal
modeling, such as incorporating external events and causal
structures. This would allow topic evolution to go beyond
statistical patterns and reveal deeper logical structures. The
framework can also be applied to cross-lingual and cross-
domain corpora to test its adaptability and robustness on larger
and more diverse datasets. As large models are deployed more
widely, temporal topic modeling is expected to become an
important component of intelligent information processing,
with long-term impact on academic research, industrial practice,
and social governance.
