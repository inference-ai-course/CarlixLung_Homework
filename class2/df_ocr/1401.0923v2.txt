Abstract

We present a perturbative QCD factorization formalism for inclusive production of heavy quarko-
nia of large transverse momentum, pr at collider energies, including both leading power (LP) and
next-to-leading power (NLP) behavior in pr. We demonstrate that both LP and NLP contributions
can be factorized in terms of perturbatively calculable short-distance partonic coefficient functions
and universal non-perturbative fragmentation functions, and derive the evolution equations that
are implied by the factorization. We identify projection operators for all channels of the factor-
ized LP and NLP infrared safe short-distance partonic hard parts, and corresponding operator
definitions of fragmentation functions. For the NLP, we focus on the contributions involving the
production of a heavy quark pair, a necessary condition for producing a heavy quarkonium. We
evaluate the first non-trivial order of evolution kernels for all relevant fragmentation functions, and

discuss the role of NLP contributions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Almost forty years since the discovery of the J/~ [fl], B], the production of heavy quarkonia
remains one of the most active and fascinating subjects in strong interaction physics } ff].
The inclusive production of a pair of charm or bottom quarks is an essentially perturbative
process because the heavy quark mass mg is much larger than Agcp, while the subsequent
evolution of the pair into a quarkonium is nonperturbative. Different treatments of the
nonperturbative transformation from a heavy quark pair to a bound quarkonium have led
to various theoretical models for quarkonium production, most notably, the color singlet
model (CSM), the color evaporation model (CEM), and the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD)
model [3 bh]. Among these models, the NRQCD treatment of heavy quarkonium production,
proposed in Ref. {6], is both the most theoretically sound and phenomenologically successful
Bo8.

With full next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions in powers of a, and properly fitted
NRQCD long-distance matrix elements, theory predictions for inclusive J/q and Y produc-
tion are generally consistent with experimental data from the Tevatron and the LHC [10H13}.
However, global fits of data on J/w production from various high energy collisions, includ-
ing ete~, lepton-hadron, and hadron-hadron collisions show slight discrepancies of
shape compared to data [f]. In addition, existing theoretical calculations have
not been able to explain fully the polarization of high-pr heavy quarkonia at the Tevatron
and LHC P22]. Motivated in part by these challenges to existing theory, new ap-
proaches based on perturbative QCD factorization P3}24] and soft-collinear effective theory
27, have been proposed for the systematic study of heavy quarkonium production at
collider energies.

In this paper, we follow up our earlier work 26] and develop an extended QCD
factorization formalism beyond the leading power for heavy quarkonium production at large
transverse momentum pr >> my > Agcp in hadronic collisions (or at a large energy E' >

*e~ collisions). In this approach, we first expand the cross section in a power series of

My ine
1/p3., and argue that the first two terms of the expansion can be factorized systematically into
infrared safe short-distance partonic functions in convolution with universal long-distance
matrix elements. The relevant matrix elements for quarkonium production then take the

form of generalized fragmentation functions, for which we derive a set of evolution equations


that mix single-parton and heavy quark-pair states. The importance of the evolution of
quark pair states was suggested originally by calculations in the color singlet model.

Although it was proposed shortly after the discovery of J/w, the CSM is still a valuable
tool for heavy quarkonium production, since it has practically no free parameters once the
heavy quarkonium wave function at the origin is fixed by data on heavy quarkonium decay
[2985]. In addition, the CSM is actually a special case of NRQCD [B]. Nevertheless, at
leading order (LO) in powers of strong coupling constant, a;, the CSM cross section falls
off as 1/p5. and is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the Tevatron data on
J/w production. A complete CSM calculation at NLO and an estimated contribution at
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) to hadronic heavy quarkonium production became
available in B6+B8]. It was found, surprisingly, that at large pr, the NLO contribution is
more than a factor of 10 larger than the CSM LO result, for pr values characteristic of
Tevatron data. Although still far below collider data, it behaves as 1/p{, rather than 1/p%..
As we shall see in the next section, this correction is due to heavy quark pairs produced at
short distances, which convert radiatively to color singlet configurations. Estimates of the
NNLO contributions suggest further significant enhancements in the CSM cross section over
the NLO result.

In contrast to the NLO enhancement found in its CSM sector, in full NRQCD factor-
ization, supplemented by leading-power evolution, quarkonium production at high pr is
dominated by single gluon production at short distances, ~ O(1/pr), beginning at LO. The
gluon then fragments into a heavy quark pair only at a much later time ~ O(1/(2mg)) in
the pair rest frame. The bound state quarkonium forms over even larger time scales, of
order 1/(mgv), with v a typical relative velocity in the pair rest frame. This subprocess
has the leading power partonic production rate of 1/p}. It is largely responsible for the
NRQCD prediction that heavy quarkonia produced at large pr are dominated by transverse
polarization J], which has not, however, been supported by all existing data J.

Part of the motivation for this study is to explore the possibility that with the large
phase space available for producing a heavy quark pair with high pr at collider energies, the
production of the heavy quark pair at the “last minute”, that is, at O(1/(2mg)), may not
be the whole story. Heavy quark pairs could be produced directly at the hard collision of
the distance scale of O(1/pr), indeed, at any time between O(1/pr) and O(1/(2mg)). As
illustrated by the CSM at NLO, prompt heavy quark pairs contribute to the cross section at


next-to-leading power (NLP), 1/p%, but generally, pairs produced from gluon evolution at
intermediate scales 2mg < wu < pr contribute (through evolution) at an intermediate level,
typically mo /(ppu?). The phenomenology of this evolution requires an analysis beyond
leading power in pr.

Heavy quark pair production at short distances gives the relevant NLP term in the
1/p?. expansion for the production of heavy quarkonia. Like power corrections to other
observables [B9} #0], the factorized form of this term can be proportional to either twist-
4 fragmentation functions to a heavy quarkonium or twist-4 parton correlation functions
of the colliding hadrons. We assume that the fragmentation of a heavy quark pair of the
correct quark flavor should be much more likely to produce a heavy quarkonium than the
fragmentation of other multi-parton states, and in this paper we focus only on those power
corrections involving the production of a heavy quark pair, and their fragmentation into a
physical quarkonium. A consistent treatment of NLP factorization within this framework
requires us to derive evolution equations for the factorization scale dependence of these new
fragmentation functions.

With the new factorization formalism, including evolution, we effectively organize the
production process into three stages based on the dynamics at three different energy scales:
pr, Mg and Agcp. Specifically, the three stages are: (1) production of a single parton (the
first term in the 1/p?, expansion) or a heavy quark pair (the second term in the 1/p%, ex-
pansion) at the distance scale 1/pr (or 1/F), (2) evolution between 1/pr and 1/2mg, which
includes the transformation of single partons to heavy quark pairs as well as the resumma-
tion of powers of In(p7/mg) for both single partons and quark pairs, and (3) formation of
the quarkonium between times 1/(2mg) and 1/(mgv).

Prompt pair production in the stage (1) can be calculated systematically in perturbative
QCD (pQCD) order-by-order in a, and included in the short-distance functions of the factor-
ization formalism described in Sec. []] below. The evolution and resummation of logarithms
in stage (2) is carried out by solving a closed set of evolution equations for the fragmentation
functions of single partons and of heavy quark pairs to produce a heavy quarkonium. The
operator definitions of these fragmentation functions are derived in Sec. [I]. Their evolution
equations and corresponding evolution kernels at the first non-trivial order in a, are derived
in Sec. [V} The stage of hadronization, (3), which is essentially nonperturbative, may be

treated via NRQCD. In this sense, the formalism that we develop is fully consistent with


NRQCD, although it does not directly address the question of NRQCD factorization BJ.

The predictive power of this new factorization formalism relies on the perturbative cal-
culations of the short-distance functions and the evolution kernels, and our knowledge of
the universal fragmentation functions at an input scale fo. With the operator definitions of
all fragmentation functions, given in Sec. [II], the factorization formalism provides a unique
prescription to calculate all short-distance functions and evolution kernels order-by-order in
powers of a, up to a freedom to choose the factorization scheme. In a companion paper [AI],
we present calculations of short-distance functions for all partonic production channels at
LO in powers of a,. With the evolution kernels calculated in this paper, we still need the
fragmentation functions at the input scale fo in order to make numerical predictions and
comparison with data.

The input fragmentation functions are non-perturbative, and in principle, can be ex-
tracted from fitting experimental data. As explained in our companion paper [fl], however,
we should be able to provide a good estimate of the input fragmentation functions by using
NRQCD factorization, since input fragmentation functions to heavy quarkonia can have a
large perturbative scale, fig < 2mg, which is well separated from the soft scales responsible
for the binding. Although there is as yet no formal proof for the NRQCD factorization,
the clear separation of momentum scales for the input fragmentation functions provides a
good justification for using the formalism as a reasonable conjecture. Our conclusions and

summary are given in Sec. V.

"Tn Refs. 13}, model fragmentation functions have been calculated following this approach for the

fragmentation of quark pairs into S- and P-wave quarkonia.


II. THE PERTURBATIVE QCD FACTORIZATION FORMALISM

We briefly summarize the fundamentals of the NRQCD factorization applied to heavy
quarkonium production at collider energies, and review how higher order corrections to
its perturbative short-distance functions in singlet channels produce power enhancements
relative to the behavior of the singlet channel at LO [B6-B8j. We then argue that cross
section for producing a heavy quarkonium at large transverse momentum pr >> my at
collider energies can be expanded as a power series of m3, /p%, and that the leading power
term and the first subleading power terms can be perturbatively factorized into infrared safe
short-distance functions (“hard parts”) in convolution with nonperturbative but universal
long-distance fragmentation functions. The short-distance hard parts can be systematically

calculated as a power series in a,(pr).

A. The NRQCD factorization of heavy quarkonium production at high pr

The NRQCD factorization approach to heavy quarkonium production [6] expresses the
inclusive cross section for the direct production of a quarkonium state H as a sum of “short-

distance” coefficients times NRQCD long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs),

o"(pr,me) = Y> eam (Pr, me; A)O|OBo¢ny (A) 10) - (1)
[QQ(n)]

Here A ~ O(mg) is the ultraviolet cut-off of the NRQCD effective theory. The short-distance
coefficients GgQg(n)} are perturbatively calculated in powers of a,, and are essentially the
process-dependent perturbative QCD cross sections to produce a QQ pair in various color,
spin, and orbital angular momentum states [QQ(n)| (including the parton distributions
of incoming hadrons). The LDMEs are nonperturbative, but, universal, representing the
probability for a QQ pair in a particular state, [QQ(n)] to evolve into a heavy quarkonium.
The sum over the [QQ(n)] states is organized in terms of powers of the pair’s relative
velocity v, an intrinsic scale of the LDMEs. For J/w production, for example, current
production phenomenology mainly uses four NRQCD LDMEs, corresponding to the c¢-pair
produced in 3gfI 1g) 39/81. and 3 pil states, respectively, where the superscript [1] (or
[8]) refers to a color singlet (or octet) heavy quark pair. The color singlet model and color

evaporation model can be thought as a truncation of and a special approximation to the


NRQCD approach, respectively B, #4).

In the production of the heavy quark pair that evolves into a heavy quarkonium, the
heavy quark mass, mg >> Agcp, regulates the perturbative final-state collinear logarithmic
behavior. The NRQCD factorization formalism is an effective field theory approach to
separate the long-distance soft physics at the scale mgu and below from the short-distance
hard physics at the scale of mg and larger. However, when pr >> mz, the perturbative
functions in Eq. ({i]) will have calculable powers of In(p7/mQ), which should be resummed
systematically. Furthermore, for the production of certain spin-color [QQ(n)] states, new
partonic production channels only open up beyond LO in a,. As we shall see below, some
of these channels can be enhanced by powers of pr/mg compared to their leading order
estimates. For simplicity, we discuss the CSM, as a special case of NRQCD [|p] and as
an example to illustrate power enhancements at higher orders. These considerations will
motivate an expansion of the cross section for the production of a heavy quark pair in

powers of mg/pr first, before expanding coefficient functions in powers of as.

FIG. 1: Sample lowst-order diagram for heavy quarkonium production from the gluon-gluon fusion

channel in the CSM.

In the CSM, quarkonia are formed only from color-singlet, low invariant mass heavy
quark pairs, produced perturbatively with the same quantum numbers as the bound states
in question. At LO in a,, the perturbative partonic cross section in a hadronic collision is
given by the 2 > 3 partonic subprocess, gg > QQ(P)g, that produces a pair of color singlet
heavy quarks at high transverse momentum pr, as shown in Fig. fl], where heavy quarkonium
momentum is defined in the light-cone coordinate as

Ph= ("3 e, ae pr) (2)
with rapidity y and mp = /m3, + pr, and pr = \/ p> in the lab frame. For the discus-

sion in this paper, it is more convenient to work in a frame in which the heavy quarko-
nium has no transverse component as P# = (Pt,P~,Or) with Pt = | me cosh y +

terms of the rapidity and transverse momentum in the lab frame. In order to produce a
color singlet, spin-1 non-relativistic QQ pair at this order, the spinor trace of the heavy

quark pair is contracted by the projection operator |},

where é€“(P) is the polarization vector for the spin-1 heavy quark pair, and Ci = 1/N.6;;
with the superscript “[1]” indicating a color singlet, N. = 3 for the SU(Nc) color of QCD,
and i,j = 1,2, N. the color indices of the heavy quark and antiquark. Since the final-state
gluon has to balance the transverse momentum of the produced heavy quark pair, both quark
propagators of the Feynman diagram in Fig. [I] have to be off-shell by the order of pp. With
the projection operator in Eq. (9), the fermion trace does not give an invariant that grows
with pr, and the LO cross section in the CSM behaves as 1/p%., falling much faster than the
generic 1/p; behavior of leading power 2 > 2 partonic cross sections. Phenomenologically,
the LO contribution in the CSM has the wrong pr shape for the J/w transverse momentum
distribution at collider energies, and a normalization which can be more than two orders of

magnitudes smaller than the high-prp Tevatron and LHC data fh}, {10} [11], [13].

FIG. 2: Sample NLO Feynman diagrams for heavy quarkonium production at high pr in hadronic

collisions.

At NLO, real-gluon radiative contributions to the cross section in CSM come from 2 + 4
Feynman diagrams, as shown in Fig. 2| where in addition to the heavy quark pair, there
are two light partons (or another pair of heavy quarks in the case of associated production)

in the final state, while virtual contributions come from the interference between the LO


diagram in Fig. [l]and its one-loop corrections. The additional light parton in the final-state
in Fig. PB] allows the production of a color octet heavy quark pair at distance scale 1/pr,
and opens up a large phase space for the pair to neutralize its color to become a spin-1,
color singlet at much later times, up to the order of 1/mg. In addition, the heavy quark
pair produced at the distance scale of 1/pr < 1/mg is relativistic and can be in various
relativistic spin states before the pair converts itself into the non-relativistic spin-1, color
singlet state by radiating additional gluon(s) at a later time.

The contribution from various relativistic spin states of the heavy quark pair can be
separated by a Fierz transformation to decompose the quark spinor trace, as indicated in
Fig. 2] by a dashed line. Like the LO case, the two off-shell propagators needed to produce
a heavy quark pair at large pr give a factor 1/p%.. However, at this order the heavy quark
spinor trace in the numerator can now produce a p% enhancement. Such factors are isolated
by a vector, y-P or an axial vector, y57:P spin projection as shown in the figure. In this way,
the NLO contribution can gain a pp/m@ enhancement compared to the LO contribution,
and become much larger than the LO term at high pr. It is this power enhancement that is

mainly responsible for the factor of ten enhancement discovered by explicit calculations at

NLO in the CSM |B6} 88}.

FIG. 3: Sample NNLO Feynman diagrams having the pp/ms power enhancement over the LO

contribution to heavy quarkonium production.

There is no complete NNLO calculation available for heavy quarkonium production at
high pr in the CSM. The perturbative contribution at this order receives real contributions
from the 2 + 5 Feynman diagrams with one active heavy quark pair. With an additional
parton in the final-state, this contribution can potentially gain two powers of p?, [mo en-
hancement over the LO from the type of diagram on the left in Fig. B, and one power from

the diagram on the right, respectively. Since the perturbative production rate of a single


parton at high pr already has the strongest pr behavior at 1/p7, we do not expect additional
power enhancements from contributions beyond NNLO.

In summary, in these CSM examples, the lowest order in a, for @/g@n)) is not always
consistent with the leading power in pr when pr >> mg. Large enhancements in the CSM
from higher order calculations, even at high pr, suggest that we need to supplement the
simplest perturbative expansion in the powers of a, for the CSM, and by implication for
the NRQCD factorization of Eq. (I), to take into account radiation from heavy quark pairs
produced at short, and intermediate, time scales.

We propose to expand the production cross section of heavy quarkonia at high pr in
powers of 1/pr first, when pp >> my, and only then to expand perturbatively factorizable
hard parts in powers of a,. In the remainder of this section, we argue that the cross section
for producing a heavy quarkonium at large transverse momentum at collider energies can
be expanded as a power series of 1/p%, and that the leading power term and the first
subleading power terms can be perturbatively factorized into infrared safe short-distance

hard parts in convolution with nonperturbative but universal long-distance fragmentation

functions Pq.

processes, via the production of a single parton, here a gluon, (left) and a heavy quark pair (right)

at short distance.

B. Fragmentation and the factorization formula

Producing a pair of heavy quarks is a necessary condition for producing a heavy quarko-

nium. In terms of 1/p?, expansion, the first two power contributions to the cross section of

term in the 1/ Dp expansion of heavy quarkonium production cross sections.

heavy quarkonium production at high pr can be presented in terms of the sample diagrams
in Fig. ff. These figures are shown in cut diagram notation, in which the amplitude and
complex conjugate are combined into a forward scattering diagram and the final state is
identified by a vertical line. The diagram on the left represents the leading power term in
1/p?., expansion and can be interpreted as the perturbative production of a single parton
(say a gluon of momentum p,) at the short-distance scale 1/pr. This parton fragments into
a heavy quarkonium at a much later time (~ 1/m#). The diagram on the right represents
a first subleading power term in the 1/p%. expansion and corresponds to the production of
a heavy quark pair at the short distance scale, which then fragments into a heavy quarko-
nium. In addition, there are 1/p7, power suppressed contributions to the production of a
single active parton in hadronic collisions, the diagram on the left in Fig. | These include
contributions from short-distance collisions involving a single parton from one incoming
hadron and two partons from the other, the latter being represented by twist-4 multi-parton
correlation functions [B9, [5]. Other power-suppresssed terms in the 1/p7. expansion include
the production of a pair of collinear and on-shell light partons, such as those shown in Fig. [J

plus other combinations and interferences. With all contributions up to the first subleading

quarkonium momentum has only “+” component without “—” and “LL” components. Here,
we assume that my/p* < 1. In this frame, the heavy quarkonium momentum p“ =
ptn" with a light-cone vector nm“ = (1,0,0,). The light-cone components of a general

4-dimensional momentum are k“ = (k+,k~,k,), where kt = (k° + k*)/\/2. The “+”

component of momentum p can be projected out by another light-cone vector n“ = (0,1,0,)
as pt = p-n with n-m = 1 and n? =n? = 0. Although the total momentum of the heavy
quark pair is the same for both the scattering amplitude and its complex conjugate, the
individual heavy quark momentum in the amplitude does not have to be the same as the
heavy quark momentum in the complex conjugate amplitude. That is, wu does not have to
be the same as v, as defined in Eq. (@). The range for the momentum fractions u and v, and
u and J, is 0 to 1.

Although there is non-trivial interference in the momentum fractions of the heavy quarks,
there is no interference between two-quark and single-gluon states, of the sort shown in Fig.

6, which might suggest a correction suppressed by only a single power of pr. As we shall

see in Sec. below Eq. (24]), however, after the internal integrations of the heavy quark
subdiagram are carried out, the only vectors that can couple to the gluon of momentum p, at
the vertex above the dashed line are orthogonal to the physical polarizations of that gluon.
As a result, the gluon pole at p? = 0 is cancelled, and the heavy quark loop couples to the

hard scattering through a contact term on the right of the cut. The momentum space regions

13


associated with this diagram are then absorbed naturally into the heavy quark fragmentation
term in the factorized cross section.

The cross sections dé44B-+f(p.)+X> IF4+B-+[QQ(x)|(pe)+X ANd doar Bip pq(p.)+x in Eq. (A)
include all information on the incoming states. When A and B are hadrons, the do 44 p_,/+x
in Eq. (A) includes the leading power contribution from collisions of one active parton from
each colliding hadron, which are proportional to convolutions with parton distribution func-
tions (PDFs) at factorization scale zr. They also include the first 1/p?, suppressed contribu-
tion from collisions involving one parton from one colliding hadron and two from the other,
given by convolutions of a PDF from one hadron with a twist-4 four-parton correlation func-
tion from the other [B9, 5], as noted above. The Dy_,4(z; mq) are fragmentation functions
for off-shell partons of flavor f to produce a quarkonium state H of momentum p 7].
The mg-dependence of these functions indicates that the quarkonium state H is a bound
state of heavy quarks of mass mg. The functions Diggix)+4(2,U, v;M@) are generalized
fragmentation functions defined below for a state consisting of a relativistic heavy quark
pair [(QQ(k)] to fragment into the same quarkonium state H. The Diy py.u(z, u,v; MQ) rep-
resents all twist-4 fragmentation functions, excluding those involving a heavy quark pair,
Digd(«)| +H (4; U,V; MQ), Which are already included in the second term on the right-hand-side
of Eq. @).

In this paper, we neglect all contributions involving twist-4 multi-parton correlation func-
tions of colliding hadrons, because these contributions are expected to be suppressed by
NMQcp/p7 and small even at moderate pr >> my, compared to the leading power term in
Eq. (4). For the NLP contribution, we keep only the fragmentation contribution from heavy
quark pairs, the middle term on the right side of Eq. (4). This is because only this term
can produce a pair of heavy quarks with correct quark flavor, which we assume has a much
larger probability to fragment into a heavy quarkonium than that of a light gluon at the LP,
so that it can compensate in part the power suppression of 1/p?, of the hard parts to provide
comparable contributions to the total production rate at moderate pr. That is, we neglect
the third term in Eq. (4) because we expect that the creation of a heavy quarkonium from
fragmentation functions of twist-4 light-parton states is suppressed at least by a2(mg) in
comparison with the fragmentation from a heavy quark pair with correct quark flavor. We
leave detailed estimates of the size of neglected terms to future work.

It is natural to suppose that the contribution to the heavy quarkonium production comes

14


from the region of phase space where the quark and the antiquark have the same momentum,
Pa = Pg or u=v = 1/2, which is preferred by the quarkonium wave function. However,
for a pair produced at very short distance ~ 1/pr, which is of a size too small for a physical
quarkonium to be formed, the quark and antiquark clearly do not need to have precisely
the same momentum. Their relative momentum changes while they are evolving to a lower
momentum scale by radiation. It is the non-perturbative fragmentation functions at or
near the input momentum scale (~ 2mg) that are proportional to the wave function of
the produced heavy quarkonium, which strongly suppresses those configurations where the
heavy quark and antiquark have a large relative momentum fraction. That is, at hadronic
scales, the [QQ]-fragmentation function is peaked in the region where u = v = 1/2, and
vanishes when u and v approach 0 or 1.

If the fragmentation functions fall sufficiently fast when u,v — 0 or 1, one could make
additional approximation to the factorization formalism in Eq. (ff) by setting u = v =
1/2 in the perturbative hard part do 4,5 4;QQ@(«)}+x, and derive the following approximate

factorization formula,

which, like the leading power single parton fragmentation functions, depends only on the
total momentum fraction z of the pair, carried by the observed heavy quarkonium H. With-
out knowing exactly how fast the pair fragmentation functions fall when u and v move away
from 1/2, however, we do not make this approximation in the calculations presented in this
paper.

The validity of the perturbative QCD factorization formalism in Eqs. (4) (or(®)) requires

the suppression of quantum interference between the dynamics above and below the dashed

15


lines in Fig. {J (and in Fig. 6). That is, the dominant contributions of partonic processes
in Fig. fj should necessarily come from the phase space where the fragmenting partons (the
gluon in the diagram on the left, and the heavy quark pairs on the right) are forced to their
mass shells, and are consequently long-lived compared to the time scale of the hard collision
below the dashed line. The figures illustrate how these regions arise. The momentum of the
single active parton (the gluon), P, on the left diagram in Fig. ff] is forced to Ps ~ 0 at
the boundary of phase space. Similarly, in the diagram on the right in Fig. ff] (and those in
Fig. 5) the limit of low invariant mass for the Q,Q pair is at the boundary in phase space,
and in this region the loop momentum flowing between the two lines is pinched between mass
shell singularities. This happens on both sides of the cut, that is, in the amplitude and,
independently, in the complex conjugate amplitude. It is the contribution of this, nonleading
region that is summarized in the power suppressed terms in Eq. (f) for both heavy quarks
of Fig. MJ and the light partons of Fig. f5.

We can illustrate the pinch of loop momenta in Fig. ff] by labeling the heavy quark and
antiquark momenta in the amplitude as, Pg = P/2+q and P9 = P/2 —q, respectively. The

integral over g then takes the form,

d‘q

where H (P,q,Q) represents the production of the heavy quark pair with a hard scale Q,

D(P,q) represents the fragmentation of the pair, and q is the relative momentum of the
pair in the amplitude, which does not have to be the same as the relative momentum of the
pair in the complex conjugate amplitude. If the total momentum of the heavy quark pair is
dominated by the P* component in a frame in which the heavy quarkonium is moving in
the +z direction, we can identify the relevant perturbative contribution to the integration of
q in Eq. (10) by examining the pole structure of its q~ integration. From the denominators

in Eq. (10), we have

These two denominators pinch the q~ integral so long as we are away from the region

q* + + P*/2, where one of the pair carries all the momentum, and the other is at rest. We

16


shall assume that this region is strongly suppressed for producing a bound quarkonium, and
that P+ >> mg (that is, pr >> mg in the Lab frame). In any case, it is clear from Eq. (I)
that the contributions from the diagram on the right in Fig. ] are forced into the region
of phase space where the heavy quark and antiquark are both close to their mass-shells,
and are factorized from the short-distance hard-scattering process. We must still argue, of
course, that this factorization is respected by higher orders in the perturbative expansion.

The predictive power of the factorization formula in Eq. (ff) relies on our ability to do
systematic perturbative calculations of the short-distance partonic hard parts in powers of
a, and of the evolution kernels for the scale dependence of these fragmentation functions,
as well as on the universality of the fragmentation functions. The accuracy of the perturba-
tive calculations and the strength of their predictive power depends on the stability of the
perturbative expansion in powers of a,, and the approximation of neglecting terms that are
even higher powers in the m7, /p%. expansion.

An important feature of the perturbative QCD factorization formalism in Eq. (ff) is that
the short-distance partonic hard parts should not depend on the details of the quarkonium
states they produce. Therefore, we can extract the short-distance partonic hard parts in
Eq. (4) perturbatively order-by-order in powers of a, by applying the same factorization
formula to the production of partonic states, H = g,q,q,[QQ(k)]. When H in Eq. () isa
partonic state, both the cross section to produce the partonic state on the left of the equation
and the fragmentation functions to the partonic state on the right of the equation can be
systematically evaluated by calculating Feynman diagrams order-by-order in powers of az,
with a regularization for the collinear singularity when mg/pr — 0. Since the short-distance
partonic hard parts on the right side of Eq. (ff) are infrared safe, the partonic cross sections
on the left and the fragmentation functions on the right of the factorized equation share
the same collinear divergences, if any, order-by-order in a,. That is, factorization requires
that the perturbative fragmentation functions to a given partonic state should absorb all

collinear singularities of the cross section for that partonic state.

C. Arguments for Factorization

We now go on to give a justification of the factorization formula in Eq. (f). In our

discussion, we will revisit several arguments given in Ref. [B9], where a general analysis for

17


factorization of power-suppressed corrections in hadron-hadron scattering was introduced.

The development of factorized cross sections begins with an examination of amplitudes,
most conveniently in terms of the general properties of pertubation theory diagrams [A8}.
We begin by noting that although factorization is simplest to formulate when all particles
are massless, the presence of masses does not by itself require a reformulation of factorized
cross sections [B9]. Particle mass dependence can be incorporated consistently both into
hard scattering functions and long distance parton distributions and fragmentation functions
£9, BO]. New, power-suppressed corrections to factorization in inclusive and seminclusive
cross sections are associated not with fixed mass scales, such as mg, but with long-distance,
nonperturbative effects. Power suppressed mass corrections in mo /p> can be included in the
partonic short distance functions by keeping the heavy quark mass term of pQCD Lagrangian
as a new local interaction term.

A convenient classification of potential sources of power corrections requires an analysis
of regions of momentum space where integrals are forced near or to the mass shell. In
these are referred to as pinch surfaces, an example of which we have seen in Eq. ({I0).
In principle, any pinch surface is associated either with the leading power factorized cross
section, or with a power-suppressed (and in general) factorized correction to the leading-
power factorized form. In a hard-scattering cross section, the contributions of any region
can be put into a factorized form, but this form will only be useful if its components have
some features of universality. For example, in Eq. (ff) the “new” quark pair fragmentation
function is independent of the choice of initial state, |A, B). It is possible to estimate the
overall power behavior by using the techniques of [[§], and we will not reproduce all these
arguments here.

Because any cross section, and in particular a single-particle inclusive cross section,
is effectively the sum over all possible such regions of momentum space, a cross section
do4+B—+c(p)+x/dpr for hadron C' of momentum p can in principle be thought of a sum of
factorized terms, each with its characteristic dependence on pr. Of these, the leading power
term is of special interest. In cut diagram notation [5], the relevant pinch surfaces are illus-
trated on the left-hand side of Fig. ff, This figure and other figures in this section represent
pinch surfaces in physical gauges. The situation in covariant gauge is slightly more complex,
but the basic conclusions are unchanged.

For Fig. [7, and indeed all pinch surfaces [8], on-shell lines correspond to physically

18


realizable processes involving free, classical propagation and local interaction of partons
with finite momenta. Such processes can also be dressed in all possible ways by a “cloud” of
soft partons, represented by S in the figure. In the leading configuration, one parton from
each of the two hadrons collides to initiate the hard scattering, while the spectators of each
hadron move into the final state, interacting with each other along the way. These sets of
mutually-collinear particles are sometimes referred to as “incoming jets”, J; and J2 in the
figure. The hard scattering produces a parton of momentum p, = p/z, labelled as a gluon
in the figure, with 0 < z < 1, and this parton radiates a jet, Jo/,, of collinear partons,
some of which eventually emerge into the final state, including the observed hadron C(p).
In individual perturbative diagrams, soft gluons are attached to the incoming as well as

outgoing “jets”.

FIG. 7: Leading power pinch surface corresponding to single-parton fragmentation.

The right-hand side of Fig. [shows the result of factorization, which can be demonstrated
in various way, but which is described for leading-power fragmentation in some detail in Refs.
23) Eq. At leading power, the fragmentation function D,-,c(») decouples from the rest of
the process, leaving behind the cross section o for the production of a parton of momentum

Pg = p/z, schematically as,

F142-0(p) 4X = F142394x @ Dg sc(p) -

In general, the coupling of all soft gluons to the fragmenting jet is represented (again to
leading power) by eikonal (Wilson) lines, as indicated in the figure. Conventionally, these
are chosen in a direction p, opposite to the particle momentum, p, but this is a matter of
convention. In a, soft gluons cancel in the inclusive sum over states, and the incoming jets
are organized into parton distributions. As argued in Refs. 23} 7], all leading pinch surfaces

take this form.

19


Nonleading powers in the cross section are associated with nonleading pinch surfaces,
where lines are forced to the mass shell at pinch surfaces, but where the integrals from these
regions are suppressed by extra inverse powers of pr relative to leading power. They must
still correspond to physically-realizable processes, however, and can be classified as power-
suppressed corrections to the leading factorization of Fig. [| Figure fj illustrates several

IR

basic possibilities, which we have already encountered in connection with Eq. (8) above.
Additional partons may be attached to the hard part within the incoming (or other) jet, as
indicated by T' in the figure. Extra soft gluons may attach directly to the hard scattering,
as indicated by U. The power counting of Ref. shows that pinch surfaces involving T
are nonleading by 1/Q? in any inclusive hard scattering with scale Q for unpolarized cross
sections, where Q is the hard scale (in our case, pr). Such corrections are examples of
factorization at 1/Q? into multiparton matrix elements, as discussed in Ref. [B9]. In the

same reference, it was shown that pinch surfaces involving soft lines directly attached to the

hard part are suppressed by 1/Q* in general.

FIG. 8: Nonleading power pinch surfaces associated with additional initial-state partons (T) and

soft gluons attached to the hard scattering (U).

Finally, soft lines may attach the leading fragmenting jet to other jets at the pinch surface,
as indicated by V, but now with the leading-power couplings that lead to the factorized result
of Fig. [7 removed. In this case, we must analyze these pinch surfaces from the point of view
of Ref. [B9]. We consider a region where all lines in the jet Joy,, which contains the final-
state parton, are off-shell by some fixed squared mass, call it M?. Let us take the jet’s

momentum as approximately p¢ = p"/z ~ Qn", where 7” is a light-like vector. To recall

20


our notation, we write for any jet line P“ ~ Qn“ + (M?/Q)n“ + pr, where p?, ~ M? and
where 2-n = 1,2? = n? = 0. This is a standard scaling of jet-like momentum, as developed
in M8]. Soft lines that flow into the jet must have n-components of order M?/Q for the jet
lines to remain off-shell by order M?. We consider first, as in [BQ], the “soft central region”,
where all components of soft momenta are of the same order. Once the leading terms are
removed, the first nonleading contribution is suppressed by one order of soft momentum, so
that the contributions is down by order M?/Q relative to leading power. But this is not the
end of the story. In this case, the conditions necessary to factor the soft momenta from all
other jets (as on the right of Fig. [7) are satisfied [2], and, as shown in [B9], these gluons
cancel when we sum over all cuts of the diagrams that are consistent with fixed attachments
of soft lines to the fragmenting jet Jc,,.” Remainders are now of order M*/Q*. For a more
general analysis, it is sometimes necessary to study another region of soft momenta, the
so-called “Glauber region”, in which the transverse momenta of soft gluons increase to order
M, while light-cone components remain at order M?/Q. This region, however, requires that
the soft momenta attach only to spectator lines of the incoming jets B9]. Otherwise, light
cone momentum components are not pinched, and one or both may be increased to order
M. In the case at hand, it is the n-component that is free to be deformed to order M, taking
the jet lines off-shell to order QM, and thus away from the pinch surface. We conclude that
nonperturbative effects found in this way are suppressed to order 1/Q?.

It is worth noting at this point the relationship of the above discussion of power cor-
rections to the treatment of power corrections associated with nuclear dependence in Refs.
[3] and 4). Reference was concerned with transverse momentum broadening, while
Ref. created the influence of soft rescatterings on fragmentation. In the terminology
we have introduced above, both involved an analysis of corrections of the type T in Fig.
8, and identified effects suppressed by order 1/Q?. Both are proportional to multi-parton
matrix elements in an initial-state hadron, times a perturbative hard-scattering function.
We anticipate these matrix elements to be of order dco; so that they are relatively modest
in their effects, and can be neglected for most hard scattering phenomenology, except when

enhanced, for example, by nuclear sizes [53, 54).

? Specifically, we neglect the n“ component of the soft gluon momenta in the lines of the frgamenting
jet, where they are negligible. We then integrate the remainder of the diagram over these light cone

components. The cancellation occurs in the resulting sum over final states.

21


Of course, as we have noted above in connection with Fig. , power-suppressed pinch
surfaces involving more than a single parton at the hard scattering are possible for final
state jets as well as the incoming hadrons. We generaly expect these to be small, as in the
incoming case, but matrix elements involving the hadronization of heavy quark pairs into
heavy quarkonia may be an exception. We have in mind a role for the color singlet matrix
elements of NRQCD. Of particular interest are quark pairs in a color singlet configuration
with a total transverse momentum pr or greater. These appear in pinch surfaces associated
with the production of a heavy pair at short distances, which may be created in a singlet
configuration, or may evolve into a singlet configuration. Such surfaces are illustrated in

Fig. P| and include the right-hand side of Fig.

JcQ3] _ @

FIG. 9: Nonleading pinch surface representing the production of a pair at short distances.

The leading behavior of such surfaces is suppressed by 1/p3, relative to the overall lead-
ing power that of the surfaces shown in Fig. f/, simply because two partons rather than
one attach to the hard scattering 8]. (This is the same pr-suppression as for item T in
Fig. BL) At the same time, if the nonperturbative dynamics for these processes is greatly
enhanced relative to the fragmentation functions of individual partons, and here we have
in mind the fragmentation of gluons by color octet matrix elements in NRQCD, they may
be competitive, or even dominate for a range of pr. As indicated by the figure, the same
factorization properties analyzed in Refs. 23, 7] for single-parton fragmentation apply to

the fragmentation of a jet initiated by two partons,

0142-4[QO\(3C(p) EX) 4X = F142[QQ)4x ®@ Diggyscip) » (12)

in this case heavy quarks have a total transverse momentum that is greater than or equal

to pr > mq.

22


Recalling again that nonleading pinch surfaces enter the cross section additively, we rec-
ognize the momentum configurations of Fig. 9 as the source of the heavy pair correction
term in Eq. (f). This requires us to introduce and analyze these multi-parton fragmentation
functions, in the spirit of similar analyses in Ref. and [64] for higher-twist. matrix ele-
ments for incoming hadrons. In the following, we will formulate some of the basic properties
of these new two-parton fragmentation functions, Diggscip), when the hadron C(p) is a

heavy quarkonium H.

23


Ill. THE FRAGMENTATION FUNCTIONS

Determination of the perturbative short distance functions in Eq. (f) requires the per-
turbative calculations of both the partonic cross sections on the left of the equation, and
partonic fragmentation functions on the right. The factorization assures that the partonic
cross sections and the fragmentation functions share the same non-perturbative long-distance
dynamics. The precise forms of the partonic hard parts in Eq. (ff) depend on the operator
definitions of the fragmentation functions. The operator definition for a single parton of fla-
vor f to fragment into hadrons was first introduced by Collins and Soper [6]. This definition
was further discussed in the context of heavy quarkonium production in Ref. P23} #7]. In this
section, we derive operator definitions of fragmentation functions, Diggu.j+4 (2; Us vi MQ),
for a heavy quark pair [QQ(k«)] of quantum number x including both color and spin of the
pair, to fragment into a heavy quarkonium H.

To derive explicit operator definitions for the heavy quark pair fragmentation functions,
we need to identify the leading power contribution to heavy quarkonium production in
the heavy-quark pair fragmentation channel, as sketched in the right diagram in Fig. fl
We first perform a collinear expansion of all the momenta of the the active heavy quark
and antiquark in the partonic part (below the dashed line) to reduce the four-dimensional
momentum convolutions to one-dimensional convolutions of light-cone momentum fractions.
Then we factorize color and spin indices between the partonic hard parts that produce the
pair and the fragmentation functions that describe the transformation of the produced pair to
a bound quarkonium. From this process, we drive explicit cut-vertices defining the [QQ(x)]-
fragmentation functions, and the corresponding projection operators to define the partonic
hard part for producing the pair.

We write the heavy quark pair fragmentation channel of heavy quarkonium production
in Fig. ff as

d‘pe d*q d*q [y
dO Ap+[QQ)>H(P) = | aaa (2n)4 Hap-+(aq\(Pa, Pe, Pa, Po) (13)

where H and 7 represent the process below and above the dashed line in Fig. Hl respectively.
The dashed line in the figure represents color and spinor traces between H and 7, and

dPS(P) denotes the differential phase space of the observed final-state. The function H

24


includes all necessary initial-state factors needed for calculating the cross section, including
parton distributions if A and B are hadrons. In Eq. (f[3), heavy quark and antiquark

momenta are expressed in terms of three independent momenta, p,, q1, and qo,

Pe De
P. = P=
Po = +a, Po = ap, (14)

where p. = Pg + Pa = PQ + PG is the total momentum of the pair, while q, = (Pa — Pg)/2
and gq = (Po - P53) /2 represent the relative momenta of the quark and antiquark in the
amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude, respectively. When the light-cone component
of physically observed quarkonium momentum, p* (or pr in the Laboratory frame) is much
larger than heavy quark mass, mg, and larger than the typical virtuality of active quark
and antiquark in 7, as discussed in the last section, we can approximate the contribution
to the cross section in Eq. (([3) by expanding the momenta of heavy quarks and antiquarks

in H along the direction of the observed heavy quarkonium, and obtain the leading power

term as

To complete the derivation of exact operator definitions of heavy quark pair fragmentation
functions, we need to factorize the color and spinor traces between H and T in Eq. (15).
For a pair of produced heavy quarks, the color of the pair can be in either a color singlet
“(1]” or a color octet “[8]” state with the projection operators proportional to 6.) and (t?) qs,
respectively, where a,b = 1,2...N, are color indices for the heavy quark pair as shown in
Fig. A, and t® is the generator in the fundamental representation of the group SU(N,) color.
We can assume that the function J is a linear combination of singlet and color-averaged
octet contributions. The projection operators that project on these [QQJ]-fragmentation

functions in definite color representation can be taken as

Cc

and the corresponding color projection operators for the partonic hard part as

ce, = v2 («),,| v2 (1),.| . (19)

As required, the color projection operators satisfy the normalization condition,

S- Co cyl = 51 (20)

abcd

with J, J = 1,8. However, the exact coefficients of C and C are not unique and any constant
factor can be moved between them, as long as they satisfy the normalization condition in
Kq. (20). Our choice of normalization here matches the convention often adopted in NRQCD
factorization.

The separation of the spinor traces of heavy quarks between the short-distance function
H and the long-distance part J in Eq. (([9), is implemented by a Fierz reshuffling of spinor
indices. In the limit mg/pr — 0, there are only three leading power spin projection operators

for the produced heavy quark pair in Fig. 4}
(yp) (YP Is)3 (PY) ais (21)

where the superscript “a” has two independent values. These three projection operators, up

to a choice of normalization factors to be discussed below, cover the total four spin degrees

26


of freedom of the produced heavy quark pair. They are the vector (v), axial vector (a), and
tensor (t) forms of the y matrices, respectively. The same projection operators also apply to
the produced heavy quark pair in the complex conjugate of the scattering amplitude. Note
that, because the heavy quark mass mg of the partonic hard parts is set to zero in the hard
scattering part H, the tensor projection gives nonvanishing contributions only if the trace
of heavy quark spin in H includes both projections y - py{, which have even numbers of
gamma, matrices.

The choice of coefficients for these spin projection operators is not unique, as long as the
projection operators for the production of the heavy quark pair and the corresponding spin
projection for the cut-vertices defining the fragmentation functions of the pair are normalized
to unity. We adopt the following spin projection operators for the partonic hard part, that
is, the part below the dashed line in Fig. ff]

which are independent of the momentum fractions of fragmenting quarks and antiquarks.
Correspondingly, we have spin projections for the cut-vertices that define the heavy quark
pair fragmentation functions, the part above the dashed line in Fig. f

Using these projection operators, we can verify our claim that the gluon in the quark pair-

single gluon interference diagram, Fig. | has no pole in p?, so that this contribution can be

af


absorbed into the normal diagonal quark pair fragmentation. The only projection operators
that can contribute to the interference term in Fig. § are the vector and axial vector, because
the trace of the heavy quark loop in the hard scattering would vanish otherwise (there is
no matching tensor projection in the hard part on the right of the cut where the gluon
of momentum p, emerges.) After integration of the internal loop momenta of the diagram
above the dashed line in the figure (at fixed values of the variable u on the left), the only
vectors that are left to couple to the gluon are p# and n“. Choosing the light-cone gauge,
n-A = 0, the gluon propagator G"”(p.,) is orthogonal to n“, while p#!'G,,”(pe,n) = n”/pe-n,
which depends only on the total longitudinal momentum of the quark pair. If we choose
a covariant gauge, the same cancellation follows by applying Ward identities to the hard
scattering below the dashed line and to the heavy quark loop above the line. Note that this

argument assumes that the spin of the heavy quark state is not fixed.

FIG. 10: Feynman diagram that has an endpoint singularity when the heavy quark momentum Po

vanishes.

Before discussing the matrix element realization of the pair fragmentation functions, we
will point out a technical issue characteristic of multi-parton factorization expansions, like
the one here. Consider first, the single parton fragmentation channel of heavy quarkonium
production, on the left of Fig. . The light-cone momentum of the fragmenting parton (e.g.,
P+) is always larger than final state quarkonium momentum, pT. The same is the case for
the total momentum of the fragmenting heavy quark pair on the right of the figure. In the
heavy quark pair fragmentation channel, however, the light-cone momentum of one of the
heavy quarks or antiquarks in the process vanishes when u, u, v, or U vanishes, even though
the total light-cone momentum of the pair py is always larger than the observed quarkonium
momentum, pt in both the amplitude and complex conjugate. This is illustrated by the

correction to the hard function, H in Fig. [[0, in which the heavy quark, of momentum

(P5,0,0r) = ((u/z)p*t,0,O0r). As appropriate for a line emerging from the hard part,

Pe = 0, and
(Po +k)? =2Pik7 = pik, (25)

which vanishes as u — 0. This produces a 1/u “endpoint” singularity in the corresponding
contribution to H at u — 0. Similarly, a diagram with the gluon radiated from the heavy
antiquark would give an endpoint singularity proportional to 1/u. In general, taking into
account the complex conjugate of the scattering amplitude, the partonic hard part, when
calculated by using the projection operators in Eq. (22), will have terms with endpoint
singularities proportional to 1/utvv = 1/u(1 — u)v(1 — v), where as many as two of these
factors may vanish simultaneously.

Such endpoint singularities are by no means unique to heavy quarkonium production,
and appear, for example, in the calculation of exclusive processes [55]. They will not result
in divergences in the production cross sections as long as the heavy quark pair fragmentation
functions vanish when the quark and antiquark have very different collinear momenta. With
this in mind, we could choose to move systematically such end point singularities from the
partonic hard parts to the corresponding fragmentation functions by using a different combi-
nation of spin projection operators and cut vertices. This option is discussed in Appendix [Al,
but here we will retain the projections described above.

Using the color and spinor projection operators in Eqs. (I§), ({[9), (29), and (23), we sep-
arate the color and spinor traces in Eq. ({15), and derive the factorized contribution to heavy

quarkonium production from the heavy quark pair fragmentation channel, as presented in

Eq. (),

parton correlation functions (MPCFs) of colliding hadrons, fragmentation functions (FFs)
of a single parton, a heavy quark pair, or other combination of partons, are fundamental
in QCD. Unlike PDFs and MPCFs, FFs are defined in terms of a product of two matrix
elements (one from scattering amplitude and the other from its complex conjugate). The
moments of FFs are not necessary local, because only final states with a heavy quarkonium
are included in the sum over final states, H + X, in Eq. (28). (In the following, we will
suppress the explicit sum over states.) Fragmentation functions carry the fundamental
information of how color neutral hadrons emerge from the colored parton(s) produced in
high energy collisions.

in a gauge invariant form. With insertion of gauge links, we obtain an explicitly gauge

invariant definition of our heavy quark fragmentation functions,

the heavy quark pair fragmentation functions are defined with gauge links in fundamental

representation. Such detailed gauge links are a universal feature of fragmentation functions

ol


involving colored partons [ff6], and are required for gauge invariance. We shall not review
arguments for their presence here, except to note that in the terminology of Sec. []] above
they are necessary to match the fragmentation function to the leading pinch surfaces of
the diagrams in covariant gauges. Eq. (BO) is our operator definition for heavy quark pair
fragmentation functions.

For the fragmentation of a color singlet heavy quark pair, Cl! in Eq. (18), the two gauge
links for each matrix element in Eq. (BQ) reduce to a single gauge link between the positions

of two quark fields, by the identity
[OM (y )| aa [eM (y - Yo )| ab’ = [UM (y Y a5 UD) aw ’ (32)
where we define a path ordered exponential with arbitrary beginning and endpoints by

noting that

For a color-singlet projection, the two path-ordered exponentials thus overlap and cancel
each other outside the region between the heavy quark pair.

The octet projection in Eq. (8), can be introduced in the final state at x~ = oo, or at a
finite distance, which we may think of as a three-gauge link “junction”. In this case, only
an adjoint gauge link will connect the two matrix elements, and should be chosen to extend
to infinity in the n“ direction within the matrix elements, to preserve gauge invariance. A
similar construction is necessary for octet matrix elements in nonelativistic QCD [7].

A general form consistent with gauge invariance is, for the right-hand matrix element in
Eq. (BO),

where now adjoint index C’ will be summed against the conjugate (left-hand) matrix element.

The junction has been chosen at an arbitrary point «~, and we show below that the product

does not depend on «~. The identity in Eq. (B5) is illustrated in Fig. f[2.

In summary, for color singlet fragmentation functions, no gauge link is necessary between
the two matrix elements of the heavy quark pair, while for fragmentation of an octet pair, the
matrix elements can be connected by a gauge link in adjoint representation, as in NRQCD

23, £7. In the latter case, the adjoint link connects at each end to a junction of two finite

gauge links in fundamental representation at an arbitrary location on the light cone.

IV. THE EVOLUTION OF FRAGMENTATION FUNCTIONS

In this section, we develop a closed set of evolution equations for both single-parton and
heavy quark pair fragmentation functions, which are necessary to evaluate heavy quarkonium
production at collider energies at the accuracy of 1/p% power corrections. We calculate the

evolution kernels that appear in these equations to lowest order.

A. The evolution equations

A QCD factorization formalism for a physical observable, like the one in Eq. (ff), neces-
sarily leads to evolution equations for the variation of the factorization scale. This is because
a physical cross section for heavy quarkonium production should not depend on the choice
of the factorization scale ju,

d

= Ae {Dyn (bt, MQ) ® do44B-+¢+x (ht, pr) +

+ Digan (HsMe) @ dé 4+p(Qq(n)+x (Hs Pr)} (39)
where the symbol ® represents the convolutions of parton momentum fraction shown in
Eq. (). As indicated by the choice of arguments, the fragmentations functions, D, are
independent of pr and other kinematic invariants of the hard scattering, and the hard-
scattering functions, do, are independent of the heavy quark mass. They share dependence
only on the convolution variables and a.(w). By applying the physical condition (B9) to the
factorization formula in Eq. (#) perturbatively, and demanding that the LP and NLP terms
in 1/p% vanish, we derive a closed set of evolution equations for the single-parton and heavy
quark pair fragmentation functions to this accuracy, as we now show.

Consider first the leading power in the 1/p7, expansion, keeping only the first term on
the right-hand-side of Eq. (). The physical condition in Eq. (B9}) requires

evolution kernels for a parton of flavor f and momentum fraction z to evolve into another

parton of flavor f’ carrying the momentum fraction z’. Equation (42) is the well-known

leading power DGLAP evolution equation for the fragmentation functions. Notice that to

39


calculate the kernel at this order we do not need an explicit regularization for the k7, > 0
limit, which appears in these calculations only in intermediate steps. We now show how to
extend this reasoning to the next power in pr.

Applying the physical condition in Eq. (89) to the factorization formalism in Eq. (ff),
including the NLP term, we obtain

where the prime represents 0/01n 7”, and repeated partonic indices are summed over. In
this expression, the leading-power hard scattering function dé4,¢-,;+x(pr, |) is already
fully determined at leading power, including its u-dependence, which is specified by Eq.
(#9), and which we can represent as

d6'4, Bs f--x = — fap @ dGaypoyrx- (44)

In contrast, the nonleading-power short distance function in Eq. (f3), do4,, -1Q0()| (pe) +X
which describes the production of a heavy quark pair, has two types of factorization scale
dependence.

logarithmic divergences in the evolution of the heavy quark pairs themselves. This is anal-

kernel is dimensionless. The second source of factorization scale dependence is from the
production of a heavy quark pair from a light parton, or a single heavy quark or antiquark,
and is hence proportional to do44p-,74x. As a result, this kernel has dimensions of inverse
mass squared. The only available scale is jz itself, because the heavy quark distribution

shares only this scale with the hard scatterings. We thus have for the pi-derivatives of quark

where the mass dimension of 1? compensates the dimension of the heavy quark pair frag-
mentation function Dig@(«)}.4, and where the evolution kernels are process-independent
and can be calculated perturbatively, as will be done in next subsection.

The pattern just illustrated, in which a pair of partons (in this case heavy quarks) is
produced in the course of evolution of single partons (whether quark, antiquark or gluon)
is analogous to a similar effect in the evolution of gluon distributions, as analyzed in the
context of nuclear shadowing in Refs. [b6+5&]. By analogy to that case, for very large values
of pr, leading-power evolution should dominate the relevant cross section. At the same time,
measured fragmentation functions may be expected to show substantial contributions from
lower, but still perturbative, values of factorization scales, where they mix strongly with
quark pair fragmentation functions.

In addition to diagrams similar to the one in Fig. [[3(right), which generate the power-like
collinear divergence, there are diagrams, like the one in Fig. [L4{left), that contribute to the
partonic hard part do448-.196(«)|(p.)+x in Eq. (43) with logarithmic factorization scale, j-
dependence from subtracting logarithmic collinear divergences generated by radiation from
the pair. Just as in Eq. (ff), the logarithmic divergences are absorbed into the nonpertur-
bative fragmentation functions, in this case, into the heavy quark pair fragmentation func-
tions, while the finite first term contributes to the partonic hard part dé448-.1Q6(«)}(p.) +X
in Eq. (#3). The derivative 0/0 In p? on dé 446-41Q6(«)](pe) +X» When combined perturbatively

where the evolution kernels, I, are process-independent. They will be calculated to first non-
trivial order later in this section. In Eqs. (#6) and (fq), we keep only the first subleading
power corrections involving fragmentation of heavy quark pairs, and neglect other power
correction terms, as discussed in Sec. [| Combining Eqs. (#6) and (#7), we have a closed
set of evolution equations for single-parton and heavy quark pair fragmentation functions
to heavy quarkonium.

As we shall see, the power dependence in Eq. (45) arises diagrammatically from sub-
tracting power-like collinear divergences in the partonic cross section, which result from a
single parton evolving into a heavy quark pair by radiating a light parton, for example, as
illustrated by the diagram in Fig. [[3|(right). For the heavy quark pair produced in either a
vector, an axial vector, or a tensor state, as discussed in Sec. [1] below Eq. (24), or from
explicit calculations below in this section, only the contact term of the gluon propagator in

Fig. [[3(right) contributes to the partonic cross section to produce a pair of heavy quarks. In

38


the limit pr >> mg, or equivalently neglecting the heavy quark mass, all partonic diagrams
similar to Fig. [[3(right), including those in which the final-state gluon is radiated from either

the gluon or the heavy (anti-)quark, have a power-like collinear divergence,

(kz) pe? (kz) (kz)

Similar to Eq. (ffl), the first term on the right in Eq. (#8) contributes to the partonic hard

parts, while the second term is absorbed into the nonperturbative fragmentation function, in
this case, into the single gluon fragmentation function. As in Eq. (#8), we need not regulate
the k?, > 0 limit, because we need only the dependence on ju in the short-distance functions.

Taken together, Eqs. (#6) and (#7) control the evolution and mixing of single-parton and
quark pair fragmentation functions. As we have seen, they are a direct result of factorization
at leading and next-to-leading power, Eq. (ff). Mixing proceeds through the evolution of the
single-parton fragmentation functions, which feeds into the heavy pair fragmentation func-
tions at order 1/j:?, while the evolution of the heavy pair fragmentation function is diagonal.
As noted above, this is the same pattern that is encountered in the evolution equations link-
ing single- to two-gluon distributions in nuclear shadowing [G8]. The power correction to
single-parton evolution is necessary to organize the production of heavy quark pairs at time
scales between the short-distance scale 1/pr and the scale associated with the heavy quark
mass, 1/mg. In this evolution, the heavy quark mass serves as a collinear infrared cutoff,
so that the single-power correction dominates over the entire range of evolution to which
perturbation theory can be applied. ?

The combination of the factorization formula in Eq. (ff) and the evolution equations in
Eq. (H6)) organizes contributions to the production of heavy quark pairs according to distance
scales (or times) where (or when) the pair was produced. The first term in Eq. (4) describes

the production of the heavy quark pairs at any fixed time after the initial hard collision.

3 We also note in passing that these evolution equations, in which the logarithmic derivatives of matrix
elements of lower-dimension operators give terms proportional to (“mix with”) with matrix elements of
higher dimension operators, but not vice-versa (or not from the process like the one in Fig. f4(right)), is
the opposite of the mixing found from the renormalization of composite operators with dimension greater
than four. The matrix elements of such operators will involve positive powers of a UV cutoff yu in general,
and derivatives of these matrix elements will generate matrix elements of operators with lower, rather
than higher, dimension. The essential difference is that the latter are ultraviolet divergences, and the

former collinear singularities.

39


This term behaves as 1/p7. The second term describes pair production right at the hard
collision, and behaves as 1/p%. It is important to emphasize, however, that the 1/p7. term
includes contributions from pairs produced at any fixed time scale smaller than 1/mg. The
full evolution equation of the single parton fragmentation function in Eq. (6) describes
how the heavy quark pair is produced at any intermediate, but still perturbative, scale in
the fragmentation process. The DGLAP, leading power contribution, the first term on the
right of Eq. (6), describes the evolution of the single active parton before the creation of
the heavy quark pair. The power suppressed second term in Eq. (f6) then organizes the
production of the heavy quark pair at any stage during the evolution. Pairs produced at
intermediate times then evolve according to Eq. (#7), in general changing their spin and
color through radiation. If the evolution equation (44) has only the DGLAP term on the
right, the evolved single parton fragmentation function is restricted to the situation when
the heavy quark pair is produced at the latest times, 1/mg or beyond. The presence of
the second term in the evolution equation Eq. (#6), the mixing term, completes the picture
by allowing the production of heavy quark pairs between the time scale of the initial hard

collision, 1/pr and the time scale of 1/mg.

B. Kernels of mixed evolution

In this subsection, we present our calculation of the new evolution kernels,
Vp[20(n') (4/2, w, v', ws), which are responsible for the evolution of a single parton of flavor
f to a heavy quark pair, at the first non-trivial order in ay.

We will extract evolution kernels below by evaluating the factorization scale dependence
of parton fragmentation functions. Because evolution kernels are perturbative, we can derive
them by studying the scale dependence of parton fragmentation functions to partonic states.
More specifically, for extracting the kernel, 7 p_,;QQ@(x"y (2/2, u’, v', Us), We apply the factorized
evolution equations in Eq. (ff6) to states of a perturbative heavy quark pair, H = [QQ(K’)]
where «’ represents a spin and color state of the pair. In this way, both single quark and gluon
fragmentation functions to a heavy quark pair can be represented by Feynman diagrams, as

shown in Fig. [I5|, with the following cut vertex,

In either case, it is clear from Eq. (64) that the fragmentation function for a single light quark

to a heavy quark pair has a power-like collinear divergence, in contrast to the logarithmic
collinear divergence of leading twist single parton fragmentation functions. As noted above,
this is because the single parton and heavy quark pair fragmentation functions have different
mass dimension. The mixing evolution kernels thus have dimension 1/mass”. Because of
the mass dimension, the normalization of this evolution kernel is sensitive to the choice of
the factorization scale 7. In Eq. (64), we identify the factorization scale as a cutoff on the
invariant mass of fragmenting quark, p? [60,61]. Instead of the invariant mass, we could have
used another variable to regularize the power collinear divergence, such as the transverse
momentum of the fragmenting quark, p?,, as in Eq. (69). Different functional choices of the
factorization scale leads to a different z-dependence of the quark fragmentation to heavy pair
fragmentation function, and hence the corresponding mixing evolution kernel given below.
Since the fragmentation process is kinematically similar to a decay process for the active
fragmenting parton, however, the cut-off on the invariant mass of the fragmenting parton

not only regularizes the collinear divergence, but also controls the available phase space for

45


the fragmentation process and gives the correct threshold behavior if we produce a massive
particle, such as heavy quarkonium [60, Bi]. This is the choice we shall make.
In summary, then, from Eq. (64), we obtain the mixing evolution kernel for a quark to

fragment into a vector heavy quark pair with octet color,

when the factorization scale is chosen to be a cutoff on the invariant mass of the fragmenting

quark. Similarly, we find that the evolution kernel for the fragmentation of a light antiquark

to a color octet vector heavy quark pair, is equal to that of the corresponding quark,

the square of the three diagrams in Fig. The diagram with a gluon special propagator
is necessary for gauge invariance of the mixing kernels for a gluon to fragment into a color

for a gluon to a color singlet heavy quark pair with the vector spin projection [QQ(v1)].

where the factor [1/4N.| represents the color factor, and where as above i = 1 — u and

transverse momentum of fragmenting gluon, p?,, we will have an extra factor (1 — z)/z on
the right of this expression.

From Egs. (68) and (70), we obtain the mixing evolution kernel for a gluon to fragment

into a heavy quark pair of the state “h = v1”,

A different choice of the factorization scale would result in a different expression for the evo-

lution kernel in Eq. ({71}), but, the difference would be finite and perturbative, and absorbed

into the corresponding fragmentation function. Evolution kernels for a gluon to fragment

into a heavy quark pair in other color and spin states are derived similarly, and the results
are presented in Appendix |B.

In addition to the evolution kernels from a light quark and a gluon to a heavy quark pair,

we also need evolution kernels for a heavy quark (and antiquark) to fragment into a heavy

quark pair, which could be important when pr >> mg. The heavy quark (or antiquark)

That is, the evolution kernels of heavy quark pair fragmentation functions are given by the
variation of the heavy quark pair fragmentation fiinctions with respect to the factorization

scale.

FIG. 22: Feynman diagrams with a virtual gluon that contribute to the first order evolution kernels

At order a, the heavy quark pair fragmentation function can receive contributions from
the squares of diagrams with real gluon radiation in Fig. 21] as well as from interference
between the diagrams with a virtual gluon in Fig. 22} and the lowest order diagram (same as
the diagram (a) without the gluon). Both real and virtual contributions to the parton level
fragmentation functions have logarithmic ultraviolet and collinear singularities that share
the same coefficients at this order, while the infrared divergences of these diagrams cancel

among themselves, as they must, from the factorization. From Eq. ({76)), the evolution kernels

Calculations for evolution kernels between other quark-antiquark states are very similar, and

complete results are given in Appendix (.

In Eq. (80), the &*-integration has a pole at z = 1, which corresponds to the infrared
divergence of the real contribution when the momentum fraction of the radiating gluon
vanishes. (This is sometimes refered as a rapidity divergence.) To make manifest the infrared
cancelation between the real and virtual contributions, we regularize this z + 1 divergence

by separating out a plus distribution,

The virtual contribution to the first-order fragmentation functions in Eq. ({?4), which

between the lowest order diagram and the diagrams with a virtual gluon loop in Fig. 22.

as u— u’. Thus the k*-integration,

consequence of the different integration limits of k*-integration between the real contribution

the real and virtual contribution have infrared divergences from the kt-integration, and
the infrared divergences are exactly canceled when the real and virtual contributions are

combined. More 1 4 the cancelation takes ue in the following k*-integration,

As required by the factorization, the evolution kernel in Eq. (113) is indeed free of any
singularity.

Evolution kernels between different spin-color states of heavy quark pairs can be calcu-
lated by using the corresponding spin-color projection operators derived in Sec. [I]. At first
non-trivial order in a;, some evolution kernels vanish. To make the evolution (or change)

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a perturbative QCD factorization formalism for the inclusive produc-
tion of heavy quarkonia at large pr, which provides a systematic approach to study their
production at collider energies beyond leading power. The factorization formalism is orga-
nized in terms of a power expansion of 1/pr, which is equivalent to an organization in terms
of the characteristic times at which the heavy quark pair is produced, before it transforms
into a physical quarkonium. The leading power contribution comes from partonic subpro-
cesses in which a single parton is produced at the hard collision, of distance scale 1/pr,
followed by single parton evolution and hadronization into an observed heavy quarkonium
at a much later time. The subleading power term, which we have discussed in this pa-
per, describes the production of a heavy quark pair, either directly at the distance scale of
1/pr, at which the hard collision takes place, or at any intermediate scale 1/1 up to 1/mg.
Although the rate to produce the pair at intermediate time 1/j is suppressed by 1/p? in
comparison with the production of single parton, the probability for the pair to become a
heavy quarkonium is larger than that for a single parton to form a heavy quarkonium by
fragmenting into a heavy quark pair at large times. We have shown in this paper that both
the leading power and next-to-leading power contributions to the production cross section
can be factorized in terms of perturbatively calculable short-distance partonic coefficient
functions and non-perturbative, but universal, fragmentation functions for partons to evolve
into observed heavy quarkonia.

We identified operators for heavy quark pair fragmentation functions, and corresponding
projection operators for calculating the factorized leading and next-to-leading power short-
distance partonic hard parts. We derived a closed set of evolution equations for both single
parton and heavy quark pair fragmentation functions. We pointed out that once we work
beyond the leading power, QCD evolution of fragmentation functions with respect to the
variation of the factorization scale mixes the heavy quark pair fragmentation functions with
single parton fragmentation functions. Such mixing in evolution corresponds to a resum-
mation of the probability for the single fragmenting parton to generate a heavy quark pair
from the distance scale of the hard collision, ~ 1/pr, to a scale, 1/f49 ~ 1/me at which the
fragmentation process becomes non-perturbative. We calculated perturbatively the lowest

order evolution kernels for all channels of heavy quark pair fragmentation functions, and

62


also derived the first order evolution kernels for a single parton to evolve into a heavy quark
pair. As expected from the factorization, all calculated evolution kernels are infrared finite.

The predictive power of this new factorization formalism relies on the infrared safety of
short-distance coefficient functions, and the universality of the process-independent fragmen-
tation functions. The short-distance hard parts reflect partonic dynamics at a distance scale
of 1/pr, and are the same for the production of all heavy quarkonium states. The leading
order short distance functions for the production of a heavy quark pair in all perturbative
color-spin states are presented in a companion paper [Al].

In order to compare our calculations with experimental data, we need fragmentation
functions at the input factorization scale, 9 < 2mg, so that the evolution equations can
evolve these input fragmentation functions to generate the fragmentation functions at any
other scales. In principle, input fragmentation functions are non-perturbative and should be
extracted from fitting experimental data, just as one derives parton fragmentation functions
to light hadrons through QCD global analysis. However, as pointed out in our companion
paper [fi], it may also be a very reasonable conjecture to use the NRQCD factorization for-
malism to calculate all input fragmentation functions. With the calculated/estimated input
fragmentation functions, and perturbatively calculated hard parts and evolution kernels, our
new factorization formalism could provide predictions with absolute normalization, which

can be tested by data from the LHC and other colliders [63].

Appendix A: Another set of spin projection operators

The explicit “end-point” singularities of the short-distance partonic hard parts, as dis-
cussed in Sec. [I], reflect the possibility that the momentum of the produced active quark or

antiquark can vanish, even though the total momentum of the pair remains finite. This kind

63


of singularity is only possible when more than one active parton is produced, and the pro-
jection operators for the production, such as those in Eq. (22), are independent of momenta
of active partons (or the spinors of produced quark and antiquark).

The apparent end point singularities could be systematically removed from the partonic
parts, if we modify the 7 - p in the spin projection operators in Eq. (23) as follows,

y:Poy-ny-P, wil
a [pe te) =(G) OP (Al)
ji

where P# = (u/z) p“, and PE = (u/z) p". With this choice, the spin projection operators
for the partonic hard parts are explicitly proportional to the momenta of the produced
heavy quark and antiquark, via y- Po = us(PQ) Ts(Po), with quark spinor u, and wu, (or
y° Po = ¥ vs(—Pg) 0.(—Pg) for antiquark), where we have neglected the quark mass for
the partonic hard parts. The explicit dependence on the momenta of the active quark and
antiquark in Eq. cancels the endpoint singularity when the momentum of the produced
heavy quark or antiquark vanishes. Correspondingly, we adjust the spin projection operators
for the cut-vertices of heavy quark pair fragmentation functions in Eq. (23) by the following

replacement,

1 pen _ a 1 on).

From Eqs. (AJ]) and (AQ), it is clear that the modification of the spinor projection operators
is effectively to move a spin-independent factor: z4/(utévv) from the partonic hard part to
the definition of the corresponding fragmentation functions. In this paper, we present our
results calculated by using the spinor projection operators in Eqs. (22) and (23), without

this replacement.

the mass singularity analytically, and by choosing the factorization scale as a cutoff of the

invariant mass of fragmenting parton.
