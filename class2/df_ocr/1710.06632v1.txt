Abstract

Lexical ambiguity can impede NLP sys-
tems from accurate understanding of se-
mantics. Despite its potential benefits, the
integration of sense-level information into
NLP systems has remained understudied.
By incorporating a novel disambiguation
algorithm into a state-of-the-art classifica-
tion model, we create a pipeline to inte-
grate sense-level information into down-
stream NLP applications. We show that
a simple disambiguation of the input text
can lead to consistent performance im-
provement on multiple topic categoriza-
tion and polarity detection datasets, par-
ticularly when the fine granularity of the
underlying sense inventory is reduced and
the document is sufficiently large. Our re-
sults also point to the need for sense rep-
resentation research to focus more on in
vivo evaluations which target the perfor-
mance in downstream NLP applications
rather than artificial benchmarks.

1 Introduction

As a general trend, most current Natural Language
Processing (NLP) systems function at the word
level, i.e. individual words constitute the most
fine-grained meaning-bearing elements of their in-
put. The word level functionality can affect the
performance of these systems in two ways: (1)
it can hamper their efficiency in handling words
that are not encountered frequently during train-
ing, such as multiwords, inflections and deriva-
tions, and (2) it can restrict their semantic under-
standing to the level of words, with all their am-
biguities, and thereby prevent accurate capture of
the intended meanings.

The first issue has recently been alleviated by

techniques that aim to boost the generalisation
power of NLP systems by resorting to sub-word
or character-level information (Ballesteros et al.,
2015; Kim et al., 2016). The second limitation,
however, has not yet been studied sufficiently. A
reasonable way to handle word ambiguity, and
hence to tackle the second issue, is to semantify
the input text: transform it from its surface-level
semantics to the deeper level of word senses, i.e.
their intended meanings. We take a step in this di-
rection by designing a pipeline that enables seam-
less integration of word senses into downstream
NLP applications, while benefiting from knowl-
edge extracted from semantic networks. To this
end, we propose a quick graph-based Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm which allows
high confidence disambiguation of words without
much computation overload on the system. We
evaluate the pipeline in two downstream NLP ap-
plications: polarity detection and topic categoriza-
tion. Specifically, we use a classification model
based on Convolutional Neural Networks which
has been shown to be very effective in various
text classification tasks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014;
Kim, 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2015; Tang et al.,
2015; Xiao and Cho, 2016). We show that a simple
disambiguation of input can lead to performance
improvement of a state-of-the-art text classifica-
tion system on multiple datasets, particularly for
long inputs and when the granularity of the sense
inventory is reduced. Our pipeline is quite flexible
and modular, as it permits the integration of differ-
ent WSD and sense representation techniques.

2 Motivation

With the help of an example news article from the
BBC, shown in Figure 1, we highlight some of the
potential deficiencies of word-based models.


Lewis Hamilton is heading to his fourth F1 drivers’
title after German GP win

The German Grand Prix was the last race before Formula 1
heads off for its four-week summer break, so it was fitting
that it consolidated the two overriding trends that have
emerged so far this year.

[J

Hockenheim was Hamilton's sixth win_in seven races, a
remarkable run that has seen a 62-point swing between
himself and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, turning a
43-point deficit into a 19-point lead.

Figure 1: Excerpt of a news article from the BBC.

Ambiguity. Language is inherently ambiguous.
For instance, Mercedes, race, Hamilton and For-
mula can refer to several different entities or mean-
ings. Current neural models have managed to
successfully represent complex semantic associ-
ations by effectively analyzing large amounts of
data. However, the word-level functionality of
these systems is still a barrier to the depth of their
natural language understanding. Our proposal is
particularly tailored towards addressing this issue.

Multiword expressions (MWE). MWE are lex-
ical units made up of two or more words which
are idiosyncratic in nature (Sag et al., 2002), e.g,
Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Formula 1.
Most existing word-based models ignore the in-
terdependency between MWE’s subunits and treat
them as individual units. Handling MWE has
been a long-standing problem in NLP and has re-
cently received a considerable amount of interest
(Tsvetkov and Wintner, 2014; Salehi et al., 2015).
Our pipeline facilitates this goal.

Co-reference. Co-reference resolution of con-
cepts and entities is not explicitly tackled by our
approach. However, thanks to the fact that words
that refer to the same meaning in context, e.g., For-
mula I-FI or German Grand Prix-German GP-
Hockenheim, are all disambiguated to the same
concept, the co-reference issue is also partly ad-
dressed by our pipeline.

3 Disambiguation Algorithm

Our proposal relies on a seamless integration of
word senses in word-based systems. The goal is
to semantify the text prior to its being fed into the
system by transforming its individual units from
word surface form to the deeper level of word
senses. The semantification step is mainly tailored

towards resolving ambiguities, but it brings about
other advantages mentioned in the previous sec-
tion. The aim is to provide the system with an
input of reduced ambiguity which can facilitate its
decision making.

To this end, we developed a simple graph-based
joint disambiguation and entity linking algorithm
which can take any arbitrary semantic network
as input. The gist of our disambiguation tech-
nique lies in its speed and scalability. Conven-
tional knowledge-based disambiguation systems
(Hoffart et al., 2012; Agirre et al., 2014; Moro
et al., 2014; Ling et al., 2015; Pilehvar and Nav-
igli, 2014) often rely on computationally expen-
sive graph algorithms, which limits their applica-
tion to on-the-fly processing of large number of
text documents, as is the case in our experiments.
Moreover, unlike supervised WSD and entity link-
ing techniques (Zhong and Ng, 2010; Cheng and
Roth, 2013; Melamud et al., 2016; Limsopatham
and Collier, 2016), our algorithm relies only on
semantic networks and does not require any sense-
annotated data, which is limited to English and al-
most non-existent for other languages.

Algorithm 1 shows our procedure for disam-
biguating an input document T. First, we retrieve
from our semantic network the list of candidate
senses! for each content word, as well as seman-
tic relationships among them. As a result, we ob-
tain a graph representation (5, F’) of the input text,
where S' is the set of candidate senses and EF is
the set of edges among different senses in S. The
graph is, in fact, a small sub-graph of the input se-
mantic network, NV. Our algorithm then selects the
best candidates iteratively. In each iteration, the

candidate sense that has the highest graph degree
maxDeg is chosen as the winning sense:

maxDeg = max_|{(s, 5’) E€EF:s'€S} (1)
se

After each iteration, when a candidate sense §
is selected, all the possible candidate senses of the
corresponding word (i.e. getLex($)) are removed
from F (line 10 in the algorithm).

Figure 2 shows a simplified version of the graph
for a sample sentence. The algorithm would dis-
ambiguate the content words in this sentence as
follows. It first associates Oasis with its rock band
sense, since its corresponding node has the high-
est degree, i.e. 3. On the basis of this, the desert
sense of Oasis and its link to the stone sense of
rock are removed from the graph. In the second it-
eration, rock band is disambiguated as music band
given that its degree is 2.2 Finally, Manchester is
associated with its city sense (with a degree of 1).

In order to enable disambiguating at differ-
ent confidence levels, we introduce a threshold 0
which determines the stopping criterion of the al-
gorithm. Iteration continues until the following
condition is fulfilled: maxDeg < 6|S| / 100. This
ensures that the system will only disambiguate
those words for which it has a high confidence and
backs off to the word form otherwise, avoiding the
introduction of unwanted noise in the data for un-
certain cases or for word senses that are not de-
fined in the inventory.

?For bigrams and trigrams whose individual words might
also be disambiguated (such as rock and band in rock band),
the longest unit has the highest priority (i.e. rock band).

4 Classification Model

In our experiments, we use a standard neural net-
work based classification approach which is simi-
lar to the Convolution Neural Network classifier of
Kim (2014) and the pioneering model of Collobert
et al. (2011). Figure 3 depicts the architecture of
the model. The network receives the concatenated
vector representations of the input words, v1., =
Vi @v2@-:--PvVn, and applies (convolves) filters F
on windows of h words, m; = f(F.vii+n—1 + 0),
where b is a bias term and f() is a non-linear func-
tion, for which we use ReLU (Nair and Hinton,
2010). The convolution transforms the input text
to a feature map m = [m1,™mg2,...,Mn—n+1)-
A max pooling operation then selects the most
salient feature 7 = max{m} for each filter.

In the network of Kim (2014), the pooled fea-
tures are directly passed to a fully connected soft-
max layer whose outputs are class probabilities.
However, we add a recurrent layer before soft-
max in order to enable better capturing of long-
distance dependencies. It has been shown by Xiao
and Cho (2016) that a recurrent layer can replace
multiple layers of convolution and be beneficial,
particularly when the length of input text grows.
Specifically, we use a Long Short-Term Memory
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997, LSTM) as
our recurrent layer which was originally proposed
to avoid the vanishing gradient problem and has
proven its abilities in capturing distant dependen-
cies. The LSTM unit computes three gate vectors


(forget, input, and output) as follows:

f, = o(Wy ge + Uf by_-1 + by),
i, = (Wig + Uj he_-1 + bi), (2)
of = 0(Wo 9 + Us ht-1 + bo),

where W, U, and b are model parameters and
g and h are input and output sequences, respec-
tively. The cell state vector c; is then computed as
ce = f cri + lk tanh(¢;) where & = We gt +
U. hy_1. Finally, the output sequence is computed
as hy = o; tanh(c;). As for regularization, we
used dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) after the em-
bedding layer.

We perform experiments with two configura-
tions of the embedding layer: (1) Random, initial-
ized randomly and updated during training, and
(2) Pre-trained, initialized by pre-trained repre-
sentations and updated during training. In the fol-
lowing section we describe the pre-trained word
and sense representation used for the initialization
of the second configuration.

4.1 Pre-trained Word and Sense Embeddings

One of the main advantages of neural models
is that they usually represent the input words as
dense vectors. This can significantly boost a
system’s generalisation power and results in im-
proved performance (Zou et al., 2013; Bordes
et al., 2014; Kim, 2014; Weiss et al., 2015, inter-
alia). This feature also enables us to directly plug
in pre-trained sense representations and check
them in a downstream application.

In our experiments we generate a set of sense
embeddings by extending DeConf, a recent tech-
nique with state-of-the-art performance on multi-
ple semantic similarity benchmarks (Pilehvar and
Collier, 2016). We leave the evaluation of other
representations to future work. DeConf gets a
pre-trained set of word embeddings and computes
sense embeddings in the same semantic space. To
this end, the approach exploits the semantic net-
work of WordNet (Miller, 1995), using the Person-
alized PageRank (Haveliwala, 2002) algorithm,
and obtains a set of sense biasing words B, for
a word sense s. The sense representation of s is
then obtained using the following formula:

|
1 i
¥(s) = Ba Det v(wi); (3)
IB. i=1
where 6 is a decay parameter and v(w;) is the em-
bedding of w;, i.e. the it” word in the sense bi-

asing list of s, i. B,. We follow Pilehvar and
Collier (2016) and set 6 = 5. Finally, the vector
for sense s is calculated as the average of v(s) and
the embedding of its corresponding word.

Owing to its reliance on WordNet’s semantic
network, DeConf is limited to generating only
those word senses that are covered by this lexical
resource. We propose to use Wikipedia in order
to expand the vocabulary of the computed word
senses. Wikipedia provides a high coverage of
named entities and domain-specific terms in many
languages, while at the same time also benefiting
from a continuous update by collaborators. More-
over, it can easily be viewed as a sense inventory
where individual articles are word senses arranged
through hyperlinks and redirections.

Camacho-Collados et al. (2016b) proposed
NASARI, a technique to compute the most salient
words for each Wikipedia page. These salient
words were computed by exploiting the struc-
ture and content of Wikipedia and proved effec-
tive in tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation
(Tripodi and Pelillo, 2017; Camacho-Collados
et al., 2016a), knowledge-base construction (Li-
eto et al., 2016), domain-adapted hypernym dis-
covery (Espinosa-Anke et al., 2016; Camacho-
Collados and Navigli, 2017) or object recogni-
tion (Young et al., 2016). We view these lists
as biasing words for individual Wikipedia pages,
and then leverage the exponential decay function
(Equation 3) to compute new sense embeddings
in the same semantic space. In order to repre-
sent both WordNet and Wikipedia sense represen-
tations in the same space, we rely on the WordNet-
Wikipedia mapping provided by BabelNet* (Nav-
igli and Ponzetto, 2012). For the WordNet synsets
which are mapped to Wikipedia pages in Babel-
Net, we average the corresponding Wikipedia-
based and WordNet-based sense embeddings.

4.2 Pre-trained Supersense Embeddings

It has been argued that WordNet sense distinctions
are too fine-grained for many NLP applications
(Hovy et al., 2013). The issue can be tackled by
grouping together similar senses of the same word,
either using automatic clustering techniques (Nav-
igli, 2006; Agirre and Lopez, 2003; Snow et al.,
2007) or with the help of WordNet’s lexicographer

files’. Various applications have been shown to
improve upon moving from senses to supersenses
(Riid et al., 2011; Severyn et al., 2013; Flekova
and Gurevych, 2016). In WordNet’s lexicographer
files there are a total of 44 sense clusters, referred
to as supersenses, for categories such as event, ani-
mal, and quantity. In our experiments we use these
supersenses in order to reduce granularity of our
WordNet and Wikipedia senses. To generate su-
persense embeddings, we simply average the em-
beddings of senses in the corresponding cluster.

5 Evaluation

We evaluated our model on two classification
tasks: topic categorization (Section 5.2) and po-
larity detection (Section 5.3). In the following sec-
tion we present the common experimental setup.

5.1 Experimental setup

Classification model. Throughout all the exper-
iments we used the classification model described
in Section 4. The general architecture of the model
was the same for both tasks, with slight variations
in hyperparameters given the different natures of
the tasks, following the values suggested by Kim
(2014) and Xiao and Cho (2016) for the two tasks.
Hyperparameters were fixed across all configura-
tions in the corresponding tasks. The embedding
layer was fixed to 300 dimensions, irrespective of
the configuration, i.e. Random and Pre-trained.
For both tasks the evaluation was carried out by
10-fold cross-validation unless standard training-
testing splits were available. The disambiguation
threshold 0 (cf. Section 3) was tuned on the train-
ing portion of the corresponding data, over seven
values in [0,3] in steps of 0.5.° We used Keras
(Chollet, 2015) and Theano (Team, 2016) for our
model implementations.

Semantic network. The integration of senses
was carried out as described in Section 3. For
disambiguating with both WordNet and Wikipedia
senses we relied on the joint semantic network of
Wikipedia hyperlinks and WordNet via the map-
ping provided by BabelNet.’

Shttps://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/lexnames.5WN.html

°We observed that values higher than 3 led to very few dis-
ambiguations. While the best results were generally achieved
in the [1.5,2.5] range, performance differences across thresh-
old values were not statistically significant in most cases.

For simplicity we refer to this joint sense inventory as
Wikipedia, but note that WordNet senses are also covered.

Pre-trained word and sense embeddings.
Throughout all the experiments we used
Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) embeddings,
trained on the Google News corpus.* We trun-
cated this set to its 250K most frequent words.
We also used WordNet 3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998)
and the Wikipedia dump of November 2014 to
compute the sense embeddings (see Section 4.1).
As a result, we obtained a set of 757,262 sense
embeddings in the same space as the pre-trained
Word2vec word embeddings. We used DeConf
(Pilehvar and Collier, 2016) as our pre-trained
WordNet sense embeddings. All vectors had a
fixed dimensionality of 300.

Supersenses. In addition to WordNet senses, we
experimented with supersenses (see Section 4.2)
to check how reducing granularity would affect
system performance. For obtaining supersenses
in a given text we relied on our disambiguation
pipeline and simply clustered together senses be-
longing to the same WordNet supersense.

The task of topic categorization consists of assign-

pre-defined set of labels.

ical topic categorization datasets. Table 1 sum-

5.2.2 Results

Table 2 shows the results of our classification
model and its variants on the three datasets.!®
When the embedding layer is initialized randomly,
the model integrated with word senses consistently
improves over the word-based model, particularly
when the fine-granularity of the underlying sense
inventory is reduced using supersenses (with sta-
tistically significant gains on the three datasets).
This highlights the fact that a simple disambigua-
tion of the input can bring about performance gain
for a state-of-the-art classification system. Also,

The dataset has 20 fine-grained categories clustered into
six general topics. We used the coarse-grained labels for their
clearer distinction and consistency with BBC topics.

the better performance of supersenses suggests
that the sense distinctions of WordNet are too fine-
grained for the topic categorization task. How-
ever, when pre-trained representations are used to
initialize the embedding layer, no improvement is
observed over the word-based model. This can
be attributed to the quality of the representations,
as the model utilizing them was unable to benefit
from the advantage offered by sense distinctions.
Our results suggest that research in sense represen-
tation should put special emphasis on real-world
evaluations on benchmarks for downstream appli-
cations, rather than on artificial tasks such as word
similarity. In fact, research has previously shown
that word similarity might not constitute a reliable
proxy to measure the performance of word embed-
dings in downstream applications (Tsvetkov et al.,
2015; Chiu et al., 2016).

Among the three datasets, Ohsumed proves to
be the most challenging one, mainly for its larger
number of classes (i.e. 23) and its domain-specific
nature (i.e. medicine). Interestingly, unlike for the
other two datasets, the introduction of pre-trained
word embeddings to the system results in reduced
performance on Ohsumed. This suggests that gen-
eral domain embeddings might not be beneficial


in specialized domains, which corroborates previ-
ous findings by Yadav et al. (2017) on a different
task, i.e. entity extraction. This performance drop
may also be due to diachronic issues (Ohsumed
dates back to the 1980s) and low coverage: the
pre-trained Word2vec embeddings cover 79.3% of
the words in Ohsumed (see Table 1), in contrast
to the higher coverage on the newswire datasets,
i.e. Newsgroups (83.4%) and BBC (87.4%). How-
ever, also note that the best overall performance
is attained when our pre-trained Wikipedia sense
embeddings are used. This highlights the effec-
tiveness of Wikipedia in handling domain-specific
entities, thanks to its broad sense inventory.

5.3 Polarity Detection

Polarity detection is the most popular evaluation
framework for sentiment analysis (Dong et al.,
2015). The task is essentially a binary classifica-
tion which determines if the sentiment of a given
sentence or document is negative or positive.

5.3.1 Datasets

For the polarity detection task we used five stan-
dard evaluation datasets. Table 1 summarizes
Statistics. PL04 (Pang and Lee, 2004) is a polar-
ity detection dataset composed of full movie re-
views. PL05!® (Pang and Lee, 2005), instead, is
composed of short snippets from movie reviews.
RTC contains critic reviews from Rotten Toma-
toes!®, divided into 436,000 training and 2,000
test instances. IMDB (Maas et al., 2011) includes
50,000 movie reviews, split evenly between train-
ing and test. Finally, we used the Stanford Sen-
timent dataset (Socher et al., 2013), which asso-
ciates each review with a value that denotes its
sentiment. To be consistent with the binary classi-
fication of the other datasets, we removed the neu-
tral phrases according to the dataset’s scale (be-
tween 0.4 and 0.6) and considered the reviews
whose values were below 0.4 as negative and
above 0.6 as positive. This resulted in a binary po-
larity dataset of 119,783 phrases. Unlike the previ-
ous four datasets, this dataset does not contain an
even distribution of positive and negative labels.

ity detection datasets. Results are generally better
than those of Kim (2014), showing that the addi-
tion of the recurrent layer to the model (cf. Section
4) was beneficial. However, interestingly, no con-
sistent performance gain is observed in the polar-
ity detection task, when the model is provided with
disambiguated input, particularly for datasets with
relatively short reviews. We attribute this to the
nature of the task. Firstly, given that words rarely
happen to be ambiguous with respect to their senti-
ment, the semantic sense distinctions provided by
the disambiguation stage do not assist the classifier
in better decision making, and instead introduce
data sparsity. Secondly, since the datasets mostly
contain short texts, e.g., sentences or snippets, the
disambiguation algorithm does not have sufficient
context to make high-confidence judgements, re-
sulting in fewer disambiguations or less reliable
ones. In the following section we perform a more
in-depth analysis of the impact of document size
on the performance of our sense-based models.

5.4 Analysis

Document size. A detailed analysis revealed a
relation between document size (the number of
tokens) and performance gain of our sense-level
model. We show in Figure 4 how these two
vary for our most consistent configuration, i.e.
Wikipedia supersenses, with random initialization.
Interestingly, as a general trend, the performance
gain increases with average document size, irre-

‘Stanford is the only unbalanced dataset, but F1 results
were almost identical to accuracy.

spective of the classification task. We attribute this
to two main factors:

1. Sparsity: Splitting a word into multiple word
senses can have the negative side effect that
the corresponding training data for that word
is distributed among multiple independent
senses. This reduces the training instances
per word sense, which might affect the classi-
fier’s performance, particularly when senses
are semantically related (in comparison to
fine-grained senses, supersenses address this
issue to some extent).

2. Disambiguation quality: As also mentioned
previously, our disambiguation algorithm re-
quires the input text to be sufficiently large so
as to create a graph with an adequate num-
ber of coherent connections to function ef-
fectively. In fact, for topic categorization, in
which the documents are relatively long, our
algorithm manages to disambiguate a larger
proportion of words in documents with high
confidence. The lower performance of graph-
based disambiguation algorithms on short

texts is a known issue (Moro et al., 2014; Ra-
ganato et al., 2017), the tackling of which re-
mains an area of exploration.

Senses granularity. Our results showed that re-
ducing fine-granularity of sense distinctions can
be beneficial to both tasks, irrespective of the
underlying sense inventory, i.e. WordNet or
Wikipedia, which corroborates previous findings
(Hovy et al., 2013; Flekova and Gurevych, 2016).
This suggests that text classification does not re-
quire fine-grained semantic distinctions. In this
work we used a simple technique based on Word-
Net’s lexicographer files for coarsening senses in
this sense inventory as well as in Wikipedia. We
leave the exploration of this promising area as well
as the evaluation of other granularity reduction
techniques for WordNet (Snow et al., 2007; Bhag-
wani et al., 2013) and Wikipedia (Dandala et al.,
2013) sense inventories to future work.

6 Related Work

The past few years have witnessed a growing re-
search interest in semantic representation, mainly
as a consequence of the word embedding tsunami


(Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014).
Soon after their introduction, word embeddings
were integrated into different NLP applications,
thanks to the migration of the field to deep learning
and the fact that most deep learning models view
words as dense vectors. The waves of the word
embedding tsunami have also lapped on the shores
of sense representation. Several techniques have
been proposed that either extend word embedding
models to cluster contexts and induce senses, usu-
ally referred to as unsupervised sense represen-
tations (Schiitze, 1998; Reisinger and Mooney,
2010; Huang et al., 2012; Neelakantan et al., 2014;
Guo et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2014; Suster et al.,
2016; Ettinger et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2016) or
exploit external sense inventories and lexical re-
sources for generating sense representations for
individual meanings of words (Chen et al., 2014;
Johansson and Pina, 2015; Jauhar et al., 2015; Ia-
cobacci et al., 2015; Rothe and Schiitze, 2015;
Camacho-Collados et al., 2016b; Mancini et al.,
2016; Pilehvar and Collier, 2016).

However, the integration of sense representa-
tions into deep learning models has not been so
straightforward, and research in this field has of-
ten opted for alternative evaluation benchmarks
such as WSD, or artificial tasks, such as word
similarity. Consequently, the problem of integrat-
ing sense representations into downstream NLP
applications has remained understudied, despite
the potential benefits it can have. Li and Juraf-
sky (2015) proposed a “multi-sense embedding”
pipeline to check the benefit that can be gained
by replacing word embeddings with sense embed-
dings in multiple tasks. With the help of two
simple disambiguation algorithms, unsupervised
sense embeddings were integrated into various
downstream applications, with varying degrees of
success. Given the interdependency of sense rep-
resentation and disambiguation in this model, it is
very difficult to introduce alternative algorithms
into its pipeline, either to benefit from the state
of the art, or to carry out an evaluation. Instead,
our pipeline provides the advantage of being mod-
ular: thanks to its use of disambiguation in the
pre-processing stage and use of sense representa-
tions that are linked to external sense inventories,
different WSD techniques and sense representa-
tions can be easily plugged in and checked. Along
the same lines, Flekova and Gurevych (2016) pro-
posed a technique for learning supersense rep-

resentations, using automatically-annotated cor-
pora. Coupled with a supersense tagger, the rep-
resentations were fed into a neural network clas-
sifier as additional features to the word-based in-
put. Through a set of experiments, Flekova and
Gurevych (2016) showed that the supersense en-
richment can be beneficial to a range of binary
classification tasks. Our proposal is different in
that it focuses directly on the benefits that can
be gained by semantifying the input, ie. re-
ducing lexical ambiguity in the input text, rather
than assisting the model with additional sources
of knowledge.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

We proposed a pipeline for the integration of sense
level knowledge into a state-of-the-art text clas-
sifier. We showed that a simple disambiguation
of the input can lead to consistent performance
gain, particularly for longer documents and when
the granularity of the underlying sense inventory
is reduced. Our pipeline is modular and can be
used as an in vivo evaluation framework for WSD
and sense representation techniques. We release
our code and data to reproduce our experiments
(including pre-trained sense and supersense em-
beddings) at https://github.com/pilehvar/sensecnn
to allow further checking of the choice of hyperpa-
rameters and to allow further analysis and compar-
ison. We hope that our work will foster future re-
search on the integration of sense-level knowledge
into downstream applications. As future work, we
plan to investigate the extension of the approach
to other languages and applications. Also, given
the promising results observed for supersenses, we
will investigate task-specific coarsening of sense
inventories, particularly Wikipedia, or the use of
SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010), which
could be more suitable for polarity detection.
