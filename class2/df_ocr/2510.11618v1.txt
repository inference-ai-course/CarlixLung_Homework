Abstract

Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching
mental scene, where they envision the interactions between
characters and their environment. Inspired by this creative
process, we propose a novel approach to long-form story gen-
eration, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation,
using multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact
within a dynamic sandbox environment, where their behav-
iors and interactions with one another and the environment
generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot
progression. Unlike traditional top-down approaches that im-
pose rigid structures, our hybrid bottom-up approach allows
for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more sponta-
neous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of
generating stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining
coherence and consistency, addressing some of the key chal-
lenges faced by current story generation models. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This ap-
proach offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating
dynamic, immersive long-form stories that evolve organically
from agent-driven interactions.

Introduction

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has brought
significant advancements to various fields, including multi-
agent simulations (Li et al. 2024; Qian et al. 2024; Chen
et al. 2024). These simulations offer a powerful tool for
modeling complex interactions between virtual agents, pro-
viding a dynamic and context-rich environment for story
generation. When humans write stories, they typically have
an overarching mental picture of the story world. In our ap-
proach, multi-agent simulations are used to create this over-
arching scene, where agents (i.e., the characters in the story)
interact based on predefined behaviors, triggering emergent
events that form the foundation of the story. This allows for
the automatic generation of diverse and engaging scenarios,
which are crucial for building long-form stories.

As shown in Figure 1, the multi-agent sandbox simulation
unfolds over time, with a series of events occurring within
the sandbox. These events arise from interactions between

agents, as well as between agents and their environment. In
this process, agents act based on their predefined attributes,
responding to and influencing the world around them. The
interactions between agents and their environment give rise
to a chain of events that continuously evolve, creating a dy-
namic storyline. The sandbox thus serves as a virtual space
that mirrors the mental scene a human writer might envision
when crafting a story. It is within this evolving sandbox that
the foundations of the story are formed, from which a com-
plete story can be generated based on the events that unfold.

In this setup, the sandbox serves a critical function: it is
akin to the mental scene which a writer imagines, but with
the difference that the interactions and outcomes are auto-
matically generated through agent-based simulation rather
than purely through human imagination. Each interaction,
whether between characters or between characters and their
surroundings, adds new layers to the story. By allowing
agents to operate in this evolving and flexible sandbox, we
ensure that the story’s events are not preordained but emerge
organically from the agents’ behavior and environmental dy-
namics.


Traditional story generation often follows a top-down
method (Zhou et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023; Fan, Lewis,
and Dauphin 2019; Goldfarb-Tarrant et al. 2020; Yang et al.
2022), where a story’s structure is outlined first and then ex-
panded. Although this framework provides a guide, it can
limit natural character development and plot progression, re-
sulting in stories that feel forced or predictable. In contrast,
our hybrid bottom-up approach starts with agent-driven sim-
ulations that generate emergent events. As agents interact,
these events unfold naturally, enabling more organic charac-
ter growth and plot evolution, ultimately producing stories
with greater depth, coherence, and spontaneity.

Our approach excels at generating longer, more detailed
stories that stay consistent and cohesive. Using multi-agent
simulations, it creates diverse, meaningful events that enrich
plot and characters. Our main contributions are:

¢ A multi-agent simulation framework that generates dy-
namic and contextually rich story events through interac-
tive agent behaviors.

A hybrid bottom-up process that combines emergent in-
teractions with guided storytelling to enable natural char-
acter development and plot progression.

The ability to produce coherent and consistent long-form
stories exceeding 10,000 words, effectively overcoming
limitations of current story generation models.

Related Work
LLM-Based Multi-Agent Simulation

LLM-based multi-agent simulations have gained atten-
tion for their advanced language processing and decision-
making, enabling nuanced agent interactions (Jinxin et al.
2023; Liu et al. 2023; Feng, Feng, and Qin 2023). These
systems have been explored in various domains (Wang et al.
2024; Williams et al. 2023), particularly social simulation,
which is most relevant to our research. Social simulation
with LLM-based agents provides an effective way to model
complex societal dynamics that are otherwise difficult or
costly to study (Li, Yang, and Zhao 2023; Liet al. 2023). For
example, S? (Gao et al. 2023) investigates the spread of in-
formation, emotions, and attitudes in social networks, while
Generative Agents (Park et al. 2023) and AgentSims (Lin
et al. 2023) model daily human interactions in virtual towns.
Social Simulacra (Park et al. 2022) focuses on simulating
online community regulation, and SocialAI School (Kovac
et al. 2023) uses LLMs to simulate child development. These
studies highlight the growing potential of LLM-based agents
to offer valuable insights into societal behavior, community
regulation, and social development, which provides a foun-
dation for hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation.

Story Generation

Story generation has advanced with the rise of LLMs, which
produce fluent stories but often struggle with coherence and
consistency (Huot et al. 2024). To address these challenges,
frameworks such as outlining followed by expansion into
full stories have been proposed (Zhou et al. 2023; Wang et al.

2023). However, long-form story generation remains chal-
lenging. Recent studies have explored multi-agent systems
using LLMs (Wang, Zhou, and Ledo 2024; Nasir, James, and
Togelius 2024), such as Agents’ Room (Huot et al. 2024),
which focuses on generating stories of 1,000-2,000 words
using Planning and Writing Agents coordinated by an Or-
chestrator, and IBSEN (Han et al. 2024), which employs
Director-Actor agent collaboration for scriptwriting. While
top-down approaches, such as outlining, provide structure,
they limit natural storylines and character interactions. In
contrast, our hybrid bottom-up approach generates dynamic
stories from simulations, producing richer and more coher-
ent stories of over 10,000 words, with clear advantages over
traditional methods.

Methodology

This section introduces our long-form story generation sys-
tem (Figure 2). It has two parts: a sandbox simulating multi-
agent interactions to create events, and a Storyteller Agent
that turns these events into coherent, engaging stories.

Multi-Agent Simulation

The multi-agent simulation serves as the foundation for gen-
erating long-form stories. Both the process of long-form
story generation and standalone multi-agent simulation rely
on well-defined character settings. Inspired by the character
modeling approach of Generative Agents (Park et al. 2023),
we adopt and modify it to better suit the specific require-
ments of story generation. This modification ensures that the
characters exhibit coherent behavior and contribute mean-
ingfully to the overall story structure.

Core Attributes As illustrated in Figure 2 “Persona
Scratch Information”, we first define the initial settings for
each character. These initial settings are critical for the
agents to engage in realistic interactions and generate com-
pelling events. Each character is defined by a set of core at-
tributes, which include Name, Age, Innate, Learned, Cur-
rently, and Lifestyle. These attributes describe both static
and dynamic aspects of the character, providing a founda-
tion for their behaviors and decisions. To model the char-
acter’s daily actions, we introduce an additional attribute,
Daily Plan Requirements. This attribute contains specific
tasks or routines that the character plans to accomplish, such
as conducting research, reading papers, etc. Importantly, this
attribute is dynamic: at the start of a new day, a fresh set of
daily plans is generated. Based on these daily plan require-
ments, a detailed schedule is created, with tasks assigned to
specific hours of the day. This enables the character to fol-
low a structured routine, while leaving room for flexibility
and variation.

Abnormal Behavior Attribute To add depth and excite-
ment to the generated stories, it is crucial to incorporate el-
ements that break from routine. A monotonous, predictable
character would lead to dull and uneventful stories. There-
fore, we introduce an Abnormal Behavior attribute for each
character. This attribute determines whether the character is
likely to engage in actions that deviate from their usual be-
havior, such as abandoning their daily plan to pursue other

activities or engaging in conflicts with other characters. The
probability of a character exhibiting abnormal behavior is
controlled by a hyperparameter, the Abnormal Factor. A
higher value for this factor increases the likelihood that the
character will break from their routine and introduce more
dynamic and unpredictable actions.

Character Behavior Types Character behavior is catego-
rized into three main types: move, chat, and none. The move
behavior indicates that the character physically moves to a
different location and performs specific actions. The chat
behavior represents the character engaging in conversations
with other characters. The none behavior means the charac-
ter does nothing, allowing for moments of reflection, rest, or
inaction, which contribute to pacing and tension within the
simulation. These behaviors are selected based on the char-
acter’s current attributes and the context of the simulation.

Together, these attributes define a character’s personality,
daily routines, and potential for unpredictability, creating a
rich and dynamic environment for simulation. The agents
interact with each other based on these characteristics, gen-
erating events that reflect plausible interpersonal dynamics
and responses to environmental changes. This simulation
framework serves as the raw material for long-form story
generation, with the emergent events providing the founda-
tion for compelling stories.

Event Recording In the sandbox, every action performed
by an agent is considered an event, as illustrated in Figure 2
under “Sandbox Events”. Each event is assigned a unique
ID within the sandbox, along with a defined start time and
end time, allowing us to calculate its duration. Events can
involve multiple participants; for example, a conversation
event will always have at least two participants. Addition-
ally, each event must be recorded with its location, a brief
description of the event (referred to as description), and a
more detailed account (referred to as detail) to capture the
full context.

The description attribute provides a concise summary of
the event, such as “Starting coding on NLP models”, which
briefly explains what the event is about. However, this brief
description is often insufficient for generating a rich and en-
gaging story, as it lacks important contextual details. To ad-
dress this, we introduce the detail attribute, which expands
upon the basic description and includes additional informa-
tion necessary for story generation. The detail attribute in-
corporates factors such as the environment, the time of day,
the status of the characters involved, and the location of the
event. Furthermore, it captures character-specific elements,
including their actions, emotional states, and possible moti-
vations during the event.

By providing these details, we ensure that the events
within the sandbox are not just isolated actions, but are rich,


contextually grounded occurrences that can later be woven
into the story. This level of granularity allows the Storyteller
Agent to craft stories that are nuanced and immersive, as the
events are not only linked to character behaviors but are also
informed by the surrounding context and dynamics.
Through this multi-agent simulation, we create a dynamic
sandbox environment where interactions between characters
generate a wide variety of events. These events, rich in con-
text and detail, form the core elements for story generation.
The Storyteller Agent then processes these events, trans-
forming them into intricate, character-driven long-form sto-
ries that maintain both depth and coherence in the story.

Environment Modeling The environment plays a criti-
cal role in the sandbox. In Generative Agents, the environ-
ment is modeled using a tile-based system, where tiles repre-
sent the basic environmental units commonly found in RPG
games. However, this approach has inherent limitations, par-
ticularly the need for precise coordinates, which can make
modeling more rigid and less flexible. To overcome these
limitations, we adopt a more general tree-like structure for
environment modeling, which does not rely on specific co-
ordinates but instead uses relative distances between objects
and areas. For a detailed introduction to environment mod-
eling, please refer to supplementary material.

Unlike the fixed, grid-based environment of Generative
Agents, which confines agents to a limited simulation space,
our model enables a virtually limitless environment. This
means that the sandbox can be as large and complex as
needed, without the constraint of pre-defined spatial bound-
aries. Characters can explore a more expansive and immer-
sive world, interacting with a wider range of objects and ar-
eas, making the simulation more dynamic and fluid.

Hybrid Bottom-Up Long-Form Story Generation

Once the events generated through the multi-agent sandbox
simulation are available, the next step is to use the Story-
teller Agent to generate the long-form story. As illustrated
in Figure 3, this process follows a structured workflow that
incorporates several key stages.

Event Summarization The sandbox events are arranged
chronologically, but the sheer number of events can be over-
whelming. Directly feeding all these events into a LLM
is not feasible due to the limitations of the model’s con-
text window. Therefore, summarization is necessary. First,
we summarize the events by character, recording what each
character did on each day. This summary is also arranged
chronologically. Once we have these character-based daily
summaries, we introduce a dynamic windowing mechanism
that groups events into smaller chunks for summarization.
The size of the dynamic window is automatically determined
by the LLM, allowing for adaptability to the complexity and
density of the events. The summaries within each window
are abstract and condensed, reducing the volume of data
while maintaining chronological order. This layered and dy-
namic approach ensures that the event data remains manage-
able for the LLM while preserving key information.

Story Information Generation In the story generation
process, we first generate the story type (e.g., adventure,
mystery, romance) rather than beginning with the title. The
story type plays a crucial role in shaping the story, as it
provides a foundational framework that guides the subse-
quent development of the plot, characters, and themes. By
determining the story type at the outset, we establish a clear
direction for the story, ensuring coherence and consistency
throughout the story’s progression.

After determining the story type, we generate the story
title beginning with the initial event summary. The title is
iteratively refined with each new event summary, allowing
the model to update the title dynamically based on evolving
context. This process not only produces a cohesive and rel-
evant title but also acts as a filter, highlighting key elements
and capturing the story’s essence. The language model de-
cides whether to retain or modify the title depending on the
current event summaries.

Once the title is finalized, a secondary selection process
identifies the most suitable title. This can involve using a
language model for evaluation, manual review, or training
a dedicated model. Due to the lack of a specialized dataset,
we opt for a fully automated LLM-based approach that ranks
titles based on relevance, creativity, and coherence with the
event summaries.

Following title generation, other key story information is
produced, including background, main themes, chapter ti-
tles, conflicts per chapter, and major plot points. These ele-
ments are informed by the story type, title, and prior event
summaries, ensuring a well-structured and thematically con-
sistent story.

If manual inputs are provided, the Storyteller Agent skips
automatic generation of these elements. Additionally, hyper-
parameters like the number of themes, chapters, conflicts per
chapter, and plot points per chapter allow customization of
the story’s scope and depth.

Story Generation Once the story information is ready, the
actual story generation process begins. A key component in
this stage is the information retrieval module, which receives
two types of input data: story-related information (such as ti-
tle, themes, and chapter details) and sandbox data (including
character information, environment details, and the events
themselves). To further enhance event matching for informa-
tion retrieval, we convert events into event embeddings us-
ing an embedding model. This allows events to be retrieved
both through keyword-based search and dense vector-based
retrieval.

It is important to highlight that the process of information
retrieval and its application in story generation is inherently
bottom-up in nature. This is because the events from the
sandbox, which play a crucial role in the generation process,
are drawn upon, distinguishing this approach from tradi-
tional top-down story generation methods. Furthermore, this
information retrieval process also acts as a dynamic filtering
mechanism, automatically selecting meaningful events that
align with the story’s progression. By continuously refining
the event selection based on the evolving story, the system
ensures that only the most relevant and engaging content is

used to shape the story.

The story generation process is driven by an iterative loop.
During the generation of the first chapter, the system re-
trieves relevant information, such as the story title, themes,
and chapter details, to serve as the foundation for crafting
the content. It’s important to note that a chapter may not be
fully generated in a single pass; instead, it undergoes several
iterations before it is completed. Once a chapter is finished,
it is summarized, and the summary is added to the chapter
summary history, which serves as input for generating the
next chapter.

Each subsequent chapter’s generation includes not only
the information retrieved for the current chapter but also the
summaries of the previous chapters. This iterative process
continues, chapter by chapter, until the entire story is com-
pleted. This hybrid bottom-up method allows for the gener-
ation of long, coherent stories, where each chapter builds on
the events and summaries that have come before, ensuring
continuity and story flow.

Experiments

In this section, we present experiments to validate the effec-
tiveness of StoryBox, including evaluation metrics, baseline
comparisons, and result analysis.

Experimental Settings

Dataset Following the setup described in DOC (Yang
et al. 2023), we use premises, settings, and characters as in-
puts. However, the DOC dataset contains relatively homoge-
neous story types, so we constructed a new dataset consist-
ing of 20 story-related settings without reference answers.
Our dataset features a broader variety of story types, in-

cluding genres such as science fiction. Detailed information
about our dataset can be found in the supplementary mate-
rial.

Evaluation Metrics Evaluating generated stories is inher-
ently challenging due to the subjective, multi-dimensional,
and context-dependent nature of narrative quality (Guan and
Huang 2020; Chhun et al. 2022; Yang and Jin 2024). In-
spired by recent advances such as Agents’ Room (Huot et al.
2024), we adopt a hybrid evaluation strategy that combines
both human and automated methods to provide a compre-
hensive assessment of story quality. Building upon this foun-
dation, we expand the evaluation criteria to better suit the
story generation setting.

(1) Human Evaluation We conduct structured pairwise
comparisons across six criteria: Plot, Creativity, Character
Development, Language Use, Conflict Quality, and Over-
all. These dimensions cover key aspects of long-form story-
telling, including narrative coherence, originality, emotional
depth, and stylistic quality. Annotators with backgrounds in
literature, storytelling, and related fields compare story pairs
from the same setting and provide ratings for each dimen-
sion as well as an overall preference. To reduce fatigue and
bias, each annotator evaluates a limited number of pairs per
session. We apply a Latin Square design to balance the as-
signment of story settings and randomize story order. For
each setting, we collect M x N x (N — 1)/2 comparisons,
where MM is the number of settings and N the number of
methods.

(2) Automatic Evaluation We also use a large language
model to perform evaluations based on the same crite-
ria as human judgments. The model is guided by struc-

allows us to assess its alignment with human ratings. In addi-
tion, we include a sandbox-specific metric, Character Be-
havior Consistency, which evaluates how well characters
act in line with their defined personas. We also report Aver-
age Word Count to reflect story length.

Full metric definitions, evaluation procedures, and inter-
face details can be found in the supplementary material.

Baselines We selected several high-performing open-
source methods that can be reliably reproduced as our base-
lines. We categorize the baseline methods into three types:
(1) Vanilla LLMs: methods that generate long-form stories
directly using large language models, such as GPT-40 (Hurst
et al. 2024) and DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al. 2024); (2) Struc-
tured Frameworks: methods that utilize structured frame-
works for long-form story generation based on LLMs, such
as Re? (Yang et al. 2022) and DOC-V2 (Yang et al. 2023);
and (3) Multi-Agent Simulations: methods that generate
through multi-agent simulations, such as IBSEN (Han et al.
2024).

Implementation Details The process of implementing the
system, including the story-related settings, sandbox initial-
ization, and the setup of characters and environment, is de-
scribed in the supplementary material. The specific prompts
used in this paper, along with additional implementation de-
tails, are also provided therein.

Automatic Evaluation

We conduct an automatic evaluation of several methods,
with results shown in Figure 4(a). StoryBox consistently
achieves the best performance across all major metrics.

For the Plot metric, it maintains strong coherence, while
IBSEN performs less well, likely due to its lack of narrative-
specific design. Most models show similar results in Cre-
ativity, except DeepSeek-V3, which performs noticeably
worse, suggesting limited stylistic diversity. In Character
Development, StoryBox ranks highest, and IBSEN follows,
indicating that sandbox-based simulations are effective in
modeling character dynamics. StoryBox also leads in Lan-
guage Use, thanks to the Storyteller Agent’s integration of
environmental and contextual cues, which enriches the nar-
rative with vivid descriptions. For Conflict Quality, it per-
forms best, reflecting its ability to construct structured and
engaging tension. The Overall score confirms StoryBox’s
strong and balanced performance across dimensions. In the
sandbox-specific Character Behavior Consistency metric,
StoryBox slightly outperforms IBSEN, suggesting that sim-
ulation contributes to coherent agent behavior. Finally, in the
Average Word Count metric, which reflects long-form gen-
eration ability, StoryBox produces stories averaging around
12,000 words. Other long-form methods typically generate
about 10,000 words, while models without such adaptation
produce much shorter texts, averaging only around 1,000
words, revealing a clear limitation in generating extended
story.

Additional results, including case studies, are provided in
the supplementary material.

Human Evaluation

Given the inherently subjective nature of story generation,
human evaluation is essential for a comprehensive assess-
ment. To capture diverse reader perspectives, we recruited
78 participants from a variety of academic backgrounds, in-
cluding literature, computer science, and other disciplines.
Each participant was asked to compare pairs of stories gen-

erated from the same setting, based on the same set of di-
mensions used in the automatic evaluation.

The human evaluation results are presented in Figure 4(b).
Overall, StoryBox consistently achieves the highest scores
across all dimensions, indicating strong performance in both
structural and stylistic aspects of storytelling. This further
confirms the effectiveness of the system across a range of
reader expectations. Compared to the automatic evaluation
results in Figure 4(a), the trends are largely aligned, sug-
gesting that automatic metrics provide a reasonably accurate
reflection of human judgments. Nonetheless, some discrep-
ancies are observed, as human evaluators show a stronger
preference for IBSEN over GPT-40 and DeepSeek-V3. This
highlights the possibility that simulation-based narratives
may offer human-relatable qualities that are not fully cap-
tured by automated metrics.

Simulation Duration Study

We investigate how varying simulation durations (1, 3, 7, 14,
and 30 days) affect story quality, while keeping story length
fixed at around 12,000 words. As shown in Figure 5, not all
metrics benefit equally from longer simulations.

Plot, Creativity, and Language Use show minimal varia-
tion across durations, likely due to the strong guidance of the
Storyteller Agent and the language model’s inherent capa-
bilities. In contrast, Character Development and Conflict
Quality improve with longer simulations, as extended inter-
actions allow for deeper character arcs and more complex
tensions. The Overall metric improves significantly from
1 to 7 days, but shows diminishing returns beyond that.
Notably, token usage roughly doubles with each duration
increase, while quality gains plateau. Excessive events in
longer simulations may even burden the model’s ability to
synthesize information effectively.

Overall, a 7-day simulation strikes a practical balance be-
tween quality and efficiency, making it a suitable default un-
der current model constraints.

Ablation Study

We conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of three
components: (1) object descriptions, (2) random abnormal

behaviors, and the (3) dynamic context window. As shown
in Figure 6, removing any component leads to a performance
drop, though to varying degrees.

Excluding object descriptions harms Language Use, as
environmental details help the Storyteller Agent produce
richer and more grounded narratives. Removing random
abnormal behaviors causes the sharpest decline, particu-
larly in Creativity, Character Development, and Conflict
Quality, highlighting the importance of unpredictability in
driving dynamic stories. Disabling the dynamic context
window reduces Plot quality, as it limits the model’s ability
to maintain coherence across longer narrative arcs. Overall,
each component plays a distinct role, and their combination
is key to StoryBox’s effectiveness.

Limitations

While our multi-agent sandbox-based approach shows
strong potential, it still has limitations. First, the simulation
currently proceeds sequentially, with each character acting
one at a time, which slows down the overall process. Paral-
lelizing the simulation could improve efficiency, but manag-
ing interdependent character behaviors remains a challenge.
For instance, one character’s actions may directly affect oth-
ers, and naive parallelization could introduce inconsisten-
cies. Second, evaluating story quality is still a difficult prob-
lem. Although we use both human and automatic evalua-
tions, human judgment is costly and time-consuming. More
accurate and scalable automated metrics are needed to better
approximate human preferences and enable broader applica-
tion. These issues represent important directions for future
work.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced StoryBox, a novel approach for
long-form story generation using multi-agent simulations.
Our experiments show that StoryBox outperforms existing
methods on many metrics. Despite challenges in evaluating
story quality, both automatic and human evaluations confirm
its effectiveness in generating engaging and coherent stories.
Future work will focus on refining the sandbox environment
and exploring additional story-driven applications.

Figure 7: Overview of environment modeling using a tree-
like structure with five hierarchical levels, enabling a flexible
and expansive environment.

Environment Modeling Details

As shown in Figure 7, we divide the environment into five
hierarchical levels: World, Region, Zone, Area, and Object,
progressing from the broadest to the most specific. At the
final level, Object, each element includes a description to
capture its unique characteristics and role within the envi-
ronment. Additionally, every level in this hierarchy can be
assigned a description, although, for simplicity, we omit the
description attributes for all levels except Object in the fig-
ure.

This hierarchical structure allows characters to perceive
their environment in a flexible and context-sensitive man-
ner. Each character can be aware of their current location
as well as the objects and features within that location. By
modeling the environment this way, we create a more dy-
namic, expansive setting for agent interactions. The environ-
ment can scale beyond the limitations imposed by tile-based
systems, which typically constrain the modeling to a limited
simulated space, as seen in Generative Agents. This tree-like
model offers flexibility, allowing for a larger, more detailed
environment that adapts to the unfolding story.

Dataset Details

Table | presents a collection of 20 stories, each defined by
a premise, setting, and characters. Each story includes the
following key elements:

¢ Premise: It provides a concise description of the story’s
core plot, setting the stage for the reader to understand
the main story. This section typically outlines the primary
event or challenge in the story, whether it’s an adventure,
a mystery, or a personal transformation. The premise in-
troduces the main conflict or task that the protagonist
must address, giving the story its driving force.

* Setting: It describes the time, place, and environment in
which the story takes place. Settings can vary widely,
from futuristic cities to ancient ruins, from dystopian so-
cieties to magical realms. The setting plays an important
role in shaping the story, influencing the characters’ ac-
tions and the overall tone of the story.

¢ Characters: The characters section lists the key players
in each story, providing brief descriptions of their back-
grounds. The characters are the driving force of the plot,
and their development is crucial to the unfolding of the
story. Each character’s traits, relationships, and actions
contribute to the story’s progression and the resolution of
the conflict. By understanding the characters’ roles, read-
ers can gain insight into the emotional depth and thematic
elements of the story.

Metric Details

This section provides detailed descriptions of the evaluation
metrics used for long-form story generation, including both
human evaluation metrics and automatic evaluation metrics.

Human Evaluation Metrics

¢ Plot: This metric evaluates the structural integrity and
coherence of the narrative. A well-executed plot presents
a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end, with events
that unfold in a logical and engaging sequence. Strong
plots maintain a clear narrative direction through well-
paced turning points and developments that align with
the story’s themes and internal logic. Avoidance of plot
holes, abrupt transitions, or confusing sequences further
contributes to the clarity and momentum of the story.

* Creativity: This metric measures the originality and
imaginative strength of the narrative. A creative story in-
troduces fresh ideas, vivid characters, and emotionally
resonant themes while steering clear of clichés, stereo-
types, and formulaic tropes. The ability to craft a distinc-
tive world and storyline without leaning heavily on the
prompt reflects strong creative intent. When characters,
events, and settings feel unexpected yet meaningful, the
story gains a sense of uniqueness and depth.

¢ Character Development: This metric evaluates
the depth and progression of characters within the
story. Strong character development features multi-
dimensional individuals whose motivations, behaviors,
and decisions are clearly defined and remain consistent
with their established personas. Characters who exhibit
noticeable growth, transformation, or internal struggle
across the narrative demonstrate a compelling arc that
enhances emotional resonance. Rich backstories and
emotional complexity further reinforce the believability
and depth of the characters, making them more engaging
and authentic.

¢ Language Use: This metric evaluates the richness, pre-
cision, and stylistic impact of the language. Effective lan-
guage use is marked by varied sentence structures, pur-
poseful word choices, and the use of literary devices such
as metaphor, imagery, and descriptive detail to enhance
tone and atmosphere. Strong narratives employ language
to vividly portray settings, immersing the reader in the
physical and emotional landscape of the story. A com-
pelling narrative voice avoids repetition or flat expres-
sion, using language as a tool to deepen characterization
and sustain reader engagement.

* Conflict Quality: This metric assesses the presence, in-
tensity, and narrative function of conflict within the story.
High-quality conflict drives the plot forward, deepens
character arcs, and highlights thematic elements through
meaningful tension and stakes. Effective conflict is not
only believable and engaging, but also complex in its
emotional or moral dimensions, providing opportunities
for growth, confrontation, and resolution. The way con-
flict shapes the overall trajectory of the narrative reflects
the story’s structural and emotional depth.

Automatic Evaluation Metrics

Our automatic evaluation metrics consist of two compo-
nents. First, we adopt the same dimensions used in human
evaluation, but apply them through structured assessments
conducted by a large language model. This enables a sys-
tematic and efficient approximation of human judgments.

Second, we extend the evaluation with additional metrics
tailored to our task. In particular, we introduce a specialized
metric for multi-agent simulation-based storytelling, which
we call Character Behavior Consistency, as well as a simple
Statistical indicator, Average Word Count, which provides
insight into the overall story length. The detailed definitions
are as follows:

¢ Character Behavior Consistency: A specialized metric
for multi-agent simulation-based story generation, this
measures whether characters’ actions align with their
predefined persona settings (’Persona Scratch Informa-
tion’). Characters should act consistently with their at-
tributes, goals, and motivations, ensuring believability
and coherence in the story.

¢ Average Word Count: This metric calculates the aver-
age number of words per generated story. While basic,
it provides an indication of the story’s overall length,
which is crucial in long-form generation. Longer stories
typically allow for more extensive character development
and greater plot complexity.

Human Evaluation Details

To facilitate consistent and efficient story evaluation, we de-
veloped a custom web-based platform tailored to the needs
of our human evaluation task. An overview of the platform
interface is shown in Figure 8. To accommodate a diverse
group of annotators, the platform supports both Chinese and
English language modes. Access to the system is restricted
to verified annotators, who must log in before participating
in the evaluation process to ensure traceability and avoid du-
plicate submissions.

Each evaluation instance is based on a specific story set-
ting, under which two stories generated by different methods
are presented as Story A and Story B. For each story, the in-
terface displays the complete text along with the word count,
enabling annotators to consider both narrative content and
overall length. Annotators can switch between Story A and
Story B using the controls on the right-hand panel, where
they can also view detailed explanations of the evaluation
criteria. For each criterion, annotators are asked to indicate
which story they prefer, or to mark them as equivalent if no
preference can be determined. Once all selections are made,
the annotator submits the evaluation and is presented with
the next story pair. The backend system maintains a record
of which story pairs have been evaluated by each annotator,
thereby preventing duplicate evaluations.

Automatic Evaluation Details

To conduct automatic evaluation, we follow a prompting
strategy similar to that used in Agents’ Room, with carefully
structured templates that guide the model to emulate human

shared sense of being trapped in circumstances beyond their control.

Finally, nearby was Officer Reynolds, a police officer charged with maintaining order throughout the facility. His hand rested on his
holstered weapon, tension radiating from his posture as he appeared caught between duty and disbelief.

Claire’s mind buzzed with possibilities as she took stock of her surroundings. The anomaly had clearly affected more than just her
experiment; it was a widespread phenomenon that transcended her laboratory walls. An uneasy stillness enveloped the lab, each
heartbeat echoing in Claire's ears. Time had become a strange, palpable entity—one she could almost reach out and touch. The
realization sent shivers down her spine; this was no ordinary malfunction of her particle accelerator. It felt like more than just a
scientific anomaly—it was a moment suspended in the fabric of reality itself.

She stepped closer to the frozen teenager, whose name she recalled as Lucas, and knelt beside him. Claire had seen him struggling with
the challenges of adolescence during their sessions at the community center. His passion for science was overshadowed by his turbulent
home life, and she often wished she could reach out further to help him. Now he stood trapped, his anguish solidified in time, and
Claire found herself wrestling with a sudden surge of responsibility. If she could somehow find a way to free them all from this
moment—this purgatory—would it give him another chance?

Claire stood up abruptly, scanning the lab for any signs of movement or clues that might indicate what had gone wrong. The soft hum of
the particle accelerator now rendered silent felt like an ominous reminder of her experiment gone awry. As she moved through the lab,
the scene around her appeared both haunting and surreal. Dr. Harold Reed stood frozen near his desk, brows furrowed in concentration
as he peered at a glowing monitor displaying data that was now stuck on a single frame. Claire had always respected his intellect and
insight, but seeing him like this—suspended in time-was disconcerting. She knew he would be just as bewildered by their current
predicament.

"Dr. Harold Reed?" she called out, though she knew he couldn't hear her. The emptiness of the lab pressed against her, amplifying her
sense of isolation. She took a deep breath, willing herself to stay calm despite the chaos swirling in her mind.

Suddenly, she spotted the tech expert, Marcus, standing rigidly at his workstation with an expression of disbelief plastered on his
face. His fingers were poised above his keyboard as if he'd been caught mid-typing during a frantic attempt to diagnose whatever
glitch had caused this event. Claire had often found him abrasive and dismissive of theoretical physics in favor of practical
technology—but now there was no denying that they needed each other’s expertise.

annotation. An example of the prompt template used in our
evaluation is shown in Table 2. The prompt includes detailed
definitions of the five evaluation dimensions to ensure con-
sistency with human evaluation standards. The LLM is in-
structed to assess each story pair along these dimensions and
provide a final preference for each, enabling us to systemat-
ically collect model-based judgments that are directly com-
parable to human annotations.

In addition to standard qualitative metrics, we further
evaluate the Character Behavior Consistency of stories gen-
erated under the multi-agent simulation framework. This
metric is specifically designed to assess whether characters
act in accordance with their predefined persona attributes,
referred to as the Identity Stable Set (SS). To facilitate this
evaluation, we construct a prompt that guides the LLM to
analyze each character’s actions, decisions, and dialogue for
alignment with their ISS, as shown in Table 3. The model
is asked to rate consistency on a 0-10 scale, based on align-
ment, believability, and absence of contradictions.

For the statistical metric Average Word Count, we com-
pute the average number of words per story by simply split-
ting text based on whitespace.

Sandbox Initialization

Building a sandbox based on a multi-agent simulation re-
quires proper initialization. The initialization process relies
on the relevant settings from the dataset’s stories, including
the setup of sandbox characters and the sandbox environ-
ment. In this section, we provide an example of how the
sandbox is initialized based on the story settings from the
dataset. This example is taken from “Story 1” in Table 1.
The sandbox initialization for all stories can be found in our
project.

Character Setup

The setup of sandbox characters is derived from the under-
standing of the relevant story settings. It primarily involves
establishing the “Persona Scratch Information”, as outlined
in Figure 2, which includes details such as names, ages,
and other relevant information. Based on the description in
“Story 1”, we utilized GPT-40 mini to generate the cor-
responding character setups, as shown in Table 4. The same
approach is applied to other stories.

Environment Setup

The sandbox environment setup is similarly based on the
understanding of the relevant story settings. The goal is to
construct an environment with hierarchical relationships, as
depicted in Figure 7. In this case, drawing from the details
in “Story 1”, we used GPT—40 mini to generate the cor-
responding environment setup in the form of a YAML file,
as shown in Table 5. This method is also applied to other
stories in the dataset.


You will conduct a side-by-side evaluation. You will be given two system-generated stories.
Your task is to compare the two stories and determine which one is better based on the
following dimensions:

Plot: This metric evaluates the structural integrity and coherence of the narrative. A
well-executed plot presents a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end, with events
that unfold in a logical and engaging sequence. Strong plots maintain a clear narrative
direction through well-paced turning points and developments that align with the story’s
themes and internal logic. Avoidance of plot holes, abrupt transitions, or confusing
sequences further contributes to the clarity and momentum of the story.

Creativity: This metric measures the originality and imaginative strength of the narrative.
A creative story introduces fresh ideas, vivid characters, and emotionally resonant themes
while steering clear of clichés, stereotypes, and formulaic tropes. The ability to craft
a distinctive world and storyline without leaning heavily on the prompt reflects strong
creative intent. When characters, events, and settings feel unexpected yet meaningful, the
story gains a sense of uniqueness and depth.

Character Development: This metric evaluates the depth and progression of characters

within the story. Strong character development features multi-dimensional individuals

whose motivations, behaviors, and decisions are clearly defined and remain consistent with
their established personas. Characters who exhibit noticeable growth, transformation, or
internal struggle across the narrative demonstrate a compelling arc that enhances emotional
resonance. Rich backstories and emotional complexity further reinforce the believability
and depth of the characters, making them more engaging and authentic.

Language Use: This metric evaluates the richness, precision, and stylistic impact of the
language. Effective language use is marked by varied sentence structures, purposeful word
choices, and the use of literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, and descriptive detail
to enhance tone and atmosphere. Strong narratives employ language to vividly portray
settings, immersing the reader in the physical and emotional landscape of the story. A
compelling narrative voice avoids repetition or flat expression, using language as a tool
to deepen characterization and sustain reader engagement.

Conflict Quality: This metric assesses the presence, intensity, and narrative function of
conflict within the story. High-quality conflict drives the plot forward, deepens character
arcs, and highlights thematic elements through meaningful tension and stakes. Effective
conflict is not only believable and engaging, but also complex in its emotional or moral
dimensions, providing opportunities for growth, confrontation, and resolution. The way
conflict shapes the overall trajectory of the narrative reflects the story’s structural

and emotional depth.

Provide a detailed assessment of the two stories in terms of these five dimensions.
Conclude your assessment with scores for each dimension using the template below. Do not
add any emphasis, such as bold and italics, on your assessment.

[Story A] <Story A>

[Story B] <Story B>

The better story for each dimension is:
Plot: [A or B or Same]

Creativity: [A or B or Same]

Character Development: [A or B or Same]
Language Use: [A or B or Same]

Conflict Quality: [A or B or Same]

Table 2: Prompt template used in automatic evaluation. The LLM receives two generated stories along with detailed definitions
of each evaluation dimension, and is asked to compare them accordingly. Story content is omitted here for brevity.


You are an expert in story evaluation and character development analysis. Your task is to
assess the consistency of character behavior in a story. Consistency refers to whether
the characters’ actions, decisions, and dialogue align with their established traits,
background, and personality as described in their Identity Stable Set.

Here are the provided character descriptions (ISS) and the story for evaluation:
Character Descriptions (ISS): <Character Descriptions (ISS)>

Story: <Story>

Evaluation Task:
Behavior Consistency Analysis: Assess the story based on the following criteria:

1. Alignment with ISS: Do the characters’ actions, decisions, and speech align with their
ISS descriptions (e.g., traits, lifestyle, and current state)?

2. Believability: Are the characters’ behaviors logical and consistent within the story’s
context and their established traits?

3. Avoidance of Contradictions: Are there any moments where characters behave in a way that
directly contradicts their ISS?

Provide a score on a scale of 0 to 10, where:
0 means "The characters are completely inconsistent with their ISS descriptions."
10 means "The characters are perfectly consistent with their ISS descriptions."

Table 3: Prompt template used for evaluating Character Behavior Consistency in multi-agent simulation-based stories. The
LLM assesses whether characters’ actions and dialogue are coherent with their predefined persona attributes, using a structured
rubric and a 0-10 scoring scale.

More Implementation Details

The large language model used in this method is GPT—4o
mini. For the evaluation presented in this paper, we employ
the Llama3.1:8b-instruct—fp16 model.

Reproducing Re®

The Re? method requires the specification of a story’s
premise, setting, and character names and descriptions.
Therefore, we can directly adapt the corresponding data
from the dataset to match the required format for Re*. Since
Re? utilizes models such as text -davinci-—002, and to
ensure fairness in the experiment, we replace these models
with GPT—40 mini. For other hyperparameter settings, we
use the default configurations provided by the method.

Reproducing DOC-V2

During the reproduction of DOC-V2, we observed that the
prompts used in this method often resulted in parsing fail-
ures. Additionally, since this method does not specify the
type of story, we set the story type of this method to “narra-
tive” during evaluation. To ensure fairness, we replaced all
OpenAI engines used in this method with GPT—40 mini.

Reproducing IBSEN

During the reproduction of IBSEN, we observed that this
method primarily utilizes a multi-agent virtual sandbox for
generating theatrical scripts. As a result, it is necessary to
first convert the premise, setting, and characters from the
dataset into the specific data format required by IBSEN.

To achieve this transformation, we employed GPT—4o
mini to automatically process the conversion. This step en-
sures that the data is correctly formatted and fully compati-
ble with IBSEN’s input requirements, ultimately allowing us
to generate the necessary script files and other related out-
puts.

The final output of this method consists of log files con-
taining dialogues between different characters. Since these
logs primarily capture character interactions in a structured
manner, we leveraged a large language model (LLM) to fur-
ther refine them into coherent and fluent stories. This post-
processing step enhances readability and ensures that the
generated stories flow naturally, making them suitable for
evaluation and further analysis.

Implementation Details of StoryBox

In the multi-agent virtual sandbox simulation of this method,
several hyperparameters are configurable to tailor the envi-
ronment to the needs of the generation process. The simula-
tion is initialized at the timestamp “2024-09-01 12:00 AM”,
with each simulation step representing a time interval of one
hour. We utilize sqlite3 as the underlying database to
store and manage the simulation data.

For the embedding module, we _ use _ the
jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3 model to gener-
ate embeddings, ensuring a robust representation of textual
information. When integrating a large language model
(LLM) into the simulation, we set the model’s temperature
to 0.8, with a maximum of five attempts to parse each

generated output. Our observations suggest that this config-
uration typically allows for successful parsing within the
set number of attempts. If the output cannot be successfully
parsed within these attempts, the current iteration for the
affected agent is skipped, but the simulation proceeds with
the remaining agents.

The LLM is configured with a timeout of 60 seconds per
query. The context window size is capped at 102,400 tokens,
which is approximately 80% of the model’s maximum con-
text window capacity of 128,000 tokens. This ensures that
we maintain an optimal balance between context coverage
and computational efficiency.

In the agent’s planning module, we introduce an “abnor-
mal factor” set to 0.3, meaning that there is a 30% probabil-
ity for an agent to exhibit abnormal behavior during its plan-
ning phase. This randomness is introduced to simulate un-
predictable or creative decision-making, enhancing the dy-
namic nature of the simulation.

For the agent’s execution module, the dialogue is struc-
tured to consist of two interaction cycles, resulting in a total
of four conversational turns (two exchanges per agent). This
configuration allows for a meaningful exchange while keep-
ing the dialogue concise enough to maintain relevance to the
ongoing story.

Finally, in the FAISS-based vector database, we set the
vector dimension to 512, providing a balance between high-
quality embedding representation and efficient storage and
retrieval capabilities for the agent interactions.

In our experiments, GPU-dependent components, such
as locally deployed embedding models and large language
models, run on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. Other
models, including OpenAI’s models and DeepSeek-V3,
are accessed via API calls. When using GPT—40 mini for
multi-agent sandbox simulations, a setup with six charac-
ters and a simulation time step of one hour requires approxi-
mately 0.5 hours of real time to simulate a full in-game day.
Consequently, simulating 7 days takes around 4 hours, while
a 14-day simulation requires approximately 7 hours, includ-
ing both the simulation and story generation processes.

Case Study

We conduct a detailed analysis of a story generated by our
method, as shown in Table 7. In this table, we highlight four
key aspects: psychological descriptions, environmental de-
scriptions, conflicts, and resolutions. Psychological descrip-
tions are marked in blue with the prefix [Psychological], en-
vironmental descriptions in orange with the prefix {Environ-
ment], conflicts in red with the prefix [Conflict], and resolu-
tions in green with the prefix [Resolution]. Additionally, we
indicate omitted parts of the story by highlighting them in
gray.

The results indicate that the story contains a substantial
amount of psychological and environmental descriptions,
with each chapter beginning with an environmental setup.
In the first chapter, conflicts are relatively sparse, primarily
establishing the premise of the story. As the narrative pro-
gresses into the second and third chapters, conflicts become
more frequent, marking the development phase. In the fourth


chapter, both conflicts and resolutions emerge, signaling the
story’s climax. Finally, in the fifth chapter, conflicts and res-
olutions disappear, leaving only psychological and environ-
mental descriptions, indicating the conclusion.

Overall, the story follows a coherent structure, encom-
passing an introduction, development, climax, and resolu-
tion, aligning with conventional storytelling patterns.


Frozen Echoes: Connections in a Time-Stopped World

Chapter 1: Echoes of Silence

[Psychological] As Claire Matthews sifted through the remnants of her mentor’s cluttered
office, the coldness of the environment seeped into her bones, reminding her of the chilling
stillness that enveloped Frosthaven. [Environment] Papers were strewn about like fallen
leaves, remnants of frantic research and desperate hope. She focused on an old, dusty
notebook tucked beneath a pile of yellowed documents. Its spine cracked as she opened it,
revealing a flurry of handwritten notes filled with equations and sketches of temporal
mechanics. But what caught her attention was an erratic series of annotations in the margins,
written with a shaky hand, suggesting a connection to the anomaly that had ensnared their
eiby:.

‘“‘What is this?’’ she murmured, her pulse quickening. The ink was barely legible, but the
words ‘time fracture’ and ‘experiment 47’ stood out starkly. [Psychological] She traced the
lines with her finger, a mix of excitement and dread bubbling within her. Could this be the
key to understanding what had happened?

Just then, Dr. Harold Reed walked in, his presence cutting through the silence like a
beacon. ‘*‘Ah, Claire. Diving into the past again, are we?’’ His voice carried a warmth that
momentarily eased her growing anxiety. ...[246 words]...

As she stepped out of the office, the weight of the notebook felt heavier in her hands, a
tangible link to the past and a guiding light toward their uncertain future. [Environment]
The chilling silence of Frosthaven loomed outside, but inside, Claire’s mind buzzed with
possibilities. [Psychological] She recalled the faces of her teammates|Maya, with her
emotional insights; Sophia, with her unwavering leadership; and Tommy, whose scavenged
creativity could offer new perspectives. They were bound together not just by the anomaly,
but by their own stories, each seeking connection amidst the echoes of their frozen city.
-..[65 words]...

VN

As she entered the room, she called out, Everyone! I found something! We need to talk about
‘experiment 47’ and what it could mean for us!’’ The world outside was silent, [Psychological]
but inside her heart, a fire was beginning to blaze. [Environment] As the team gathered
around the long, battered table in the dimly lit makeshift lab, [Psychological] Claire felt

a wave of anticipation ripple through her. The notebook lay open before them, its pages a
chaotic testament to the desperation that had led to the time freeze. ...[67 words]...

He paused, looking each member of the team in the eye as if urging them to unearth their
vulnerabilities. [Environment] The faint hum of the generator in the corner provided an
eerie backdrop to the silence that followed, amplifying the gravity of Dr. Reed’s words.
‘“*T propose we share our experiences over the past weeks. Our personal insights might just
lead us to the connections we need, both in understanding this phenomenon and in healing
ourselves.’’

[Conflict] Maya, sitting cross-legged on her chair, looked up from her sketchbook. ‘‘But Dr.
Reed, can we really afford to get sidetracked by our feelings? We need to stay focused on the
science!’ ...[33 words]. «.

As Maya processed this, Tommy, who had been fidgeting with a piece of scrap metal, finally

spoke up. [Conflict] ‘‘I... I can share something. The freeze didn’t just stop time for me;
it stopped everything. I used to love scavenging through the old tech, finding treasures in
the ruins. But now.s.s,. it's Like everything I find das just a relic of a past I can’t access:

It’s frustrating. I feel like I’m stuck in a still frame.’’ ...[492 words]...


[Environment] The silence of Frosthaven still hung outside like a heavy fog, but within

the room, a flicker of warmth had taken root, hinting at the resilience they would need to
navigate the challenges that lay ahead. As the discussion wound down, Tommy sat in silence,
his eyes drifting to the corner of the makeshift lab where remnants of their scavenged
materials lay haphazardly piled together. [Environment] The metallic glint of circuit boards,
the soft sheen of unbroken glass, and scraps of colorful plastic seemed to whisper to him,
urging him to create something meaningful out of the stillness surrounding them. -.- [508
words]...

[Psychological] Claire felt a warmth spread through her chest as she watched her teammates
collaborate, their energies intertwining like threads in a fabric. ‘‘This is what we need,
isn’t it? To remember that even in the face of this freezing silence, we’re still here, still
human.’ ’”

As they stood amidst their creation, the once-frozen city outside felt a bit warmer, the
silence a little less oppressive. In that moment, they understood that art|/their shared
expression of grief and hope|was a powerful tool, one that could bridge the chasm between
their isolation and the humanity they longed to reconnect with.

With the installation complete and plans for a community gathering taking shape,
[Psychological] Claire felt an invigorating breeze of hope swell within her. The journey
towards understanding the anomaly had begun, and with it, their paths intertwined ever mor
deeply, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead together.

Chapter 2: Fractured Connections

[Environment] The afternoon sun cast a pale light over the workshop where the team
congregated, illuminating the remnants of their collaborative art installation. Claire, with
sketches scattered around her, stood by the larg asel, her brow furrowed in concentration
as she reviewed the group’s progress. The atmosphere was thick with anticipation, but
tensions simmered beneath the surface, ready to boil over.

[Conflict] Chris, immersed in his laptop, suddenly slammed the lid shut, breaking the
Silence. ‘‘We can’t keep talking about feelings, Claire! We need data, not emotional fluff!
This is about survival, not therapy!’’ His voice rose, echoing off the cold concrete walls,
causing heads to turn.

[Psychological] Claire’s heart raced. [Conflict] ‘‘How can you say that? Emotions are part
of our experience! We can’t just shove them aside as if they don’t matter! If we don’t
understand the human element, how do we hope to solve the anomaly?’’ ...[40 words]...
[Conflict] Chris scoffed, shaking his head. ‘*‘You’re both missing the bigger picture! The

anomaly is a scientific problem, and we need to treat it as such. Statistics and models,
that’s what we need! Not a group therapy session!’’

[Environment] A heavy silence followed his outburst, filled only by the distant hum of

the city’s systems, eerily frozen in time. [Psychological] Claire felt a weight settle in

her chest, her frustration mixing with the isolation she had been struggling with since

the freeze began. She took a deep breath, grounding herself. [Conflict] \I’m not asking

for therapy, Chris. I’m asking for understanding. All of us are feeling the strain of this
anomaly. If we don’t address the emotional fallout, we risk losing more than just our city|we
risk losing ourselves." ...[39 words]...

(Conflaek:] Chris threw his hends up; cutting him effy **That's: ridiculous; Temmy! This aden!
a support group! We’re not here to share our feelings; we’re here to fix a problem!’’ His
anger was palpable, and the room tensed at the ferocity of his words. ...[54 words]...

Chris clenched his jaw, visibly wrestling with his emotions as he paced the room, his
agitation bouncing off the walls. [Psychological] The others watched, feeling the weight of
the moment. Finally, he turned to Claire, his tone softening slightly. \I just... I can’t
afford to lose focus. We’re running out of time."


[Psychological] Claire’s heart softened at his vulnerability. \None of us can afford to lose
focus, Chris. But we’re not in this alone, and we shouldn’t have to carry it all on our
shoulders. What if we tried combining both approaches? We could analyze the data, but also
create a space for sharing. We could document our emotional states alongside our findings. It
might help us s patterns we wouldn’t have considered otherwise." ...[81 words]...

As the discussion shifted towards finding a framework that honored both their emotional and
scientific needs, Claire felt a warmth spread through the group. [Psychological] They were
angry, frustrated, and scared, but they were also moving toward a shared understanding,
forging a deeper connection amid the chaos. ...[903 words]...

[Environment] As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a soft golden glow over
Frosthaven, Sophia stood in the community center, surveying the room with a mixture of
excitement and apprehension. The large, open space was adorned with strings of fairy lights,
their warmth contrasting with the cold, sterile environment of their scientific workspace.
Canvas draped across tables awaited contributions, and Maya’s masterpiece, ‘Isolation’s
Embrace,’ was prominently displayed at the front, its swirling colors capturing the emotional
struggles faced by the community. ...[305 words]...

(Conflict] When it was Chris’s turn to speak, he reluctantly approached the makeshift

stage, a shadow of frustration crossing his features. ‘‘I appreciate the intent behind this
gathering, but we have to remember that feelings don’t solve the problem. We need actionable
data|statistics, research, something concrete to work with!’’ ...[405 words]...

[Conflict] Chris sighed, his shoulders slumping. ‘‘I just don’t want to lose focus. If we get
too caught up in emotions, we might miss our chance to save the city.’’ ...[35 words]...

As they exited the community center, [Psychological] Claire felt the weight of the evening’s
revelations. While the gathering had illuminated hidden tensions, it had also sparked
connections that could lead them toward healing. They were still a fractured group, but
together, they could navigate the complexities of their emotions and unite in their quest

to reclaim Frosthaven. The road ahead would be challenging, but they were beginning to
understand that it was possible to blend their individual desires with a greater purpose|one
that could ultimately drive them toward collective resilienc

Chapter 3: The Heart of Inquiry

[Environment] The air in the makeshift lab crackled with tension as Chris stared at his
computer screen, the bright glow illuminating his furrowed brow. A cacophony of beeping
alarms punctuated the silence that had settled uneasily over the group, a sound that mirrored
the rising pulse of anxiety coursing through everyone present. Claire, Maya, Sophia, and
Tommy stood gathered around him, their expressions a blend of concern and disbelief as the
reality of Chris’s actions unfolded before them.

[Conflict] ‘‘What have you done?’’ Claire’s voice trembled slightly, a mixture of fear and
frustration. She stepped closer, her mind racing with the implications of the power surge.

[Conflict] Chris, his hands still hovering over the keyboard, shot her a defiant glance.

‘“*‘T was just trying to access the central grid! If we can understand the frozen energy
signatures, maybe we can find a way to reverse this freeze. We can save Frosthaven!’’ ... [49
words]...

[Environment] The monitors flickered, reflecting a kaleidoscope of error messages and
warnings, each one a testament to the risk they were all contemplating. [Conflict] Tommy
leaned over Chris’s shoulder, his eyes darting between the screen and the faces of his
friends. ‘‘We should think this through. What if we lose everything?’’ He was usually the one
advocating for the thrill of experimentation, but this was different. The stakes felt heavier
now.



Sophia, who had been quietly observing, stepped forward. Her voice was steady, an anchor
amidst the storm. [Conflict] ‘‘We need to decide if this is the right path. We’re already
facing the consequences of our actions|what’s one more gamble on top of all this?’’ Her gaze
swept across the group, searching for consensus. ‘‘Maybe there’s another way. Let’s take a
moment to regroup and consider all our options.’’

[Psychological] Claire nodded, her heart pounding as she recalled their earlier discussions
about balancing emotional clarity with scientific inquiry. ‘‘I agree with Sophia. This isn’t
just about reversing the anomaly. It’s about us too. We need to find a solution that doesn’t
put any of you at risk.’’

[Conflict] Chris’s face hardened at their resistance, yet a flicker of uncertainty crossed

his features. ‘‘But we don’t have time to sit around! Every moment we waste, more lives are
impacted. People are trapped in this stasis!’’ His voice rose, desperation lacing his words,
revealing the turmoil beneath his bravado. ...[50 words}...

Claire watched Chris as his expression shifted, the wall of bravado beginning to crack. The
tension in the room thickened, silence stretching out like an elastic band ready to snap.
[Psychological] Finally, Chris slumped back in his chair, his anger dissipating into a weary
resignation. ‘*‘I just thought... maybe this was the way to prove I’m not just a tech geek who
hides behind a screen. I wanted to be part of something bigger.’’ ...[30 words]...

The group sat in contemplative silence, the weight of their shared isolation settling among
them. [Psychological] Claire inhaled deeply, her resolve strengthening. ‘‘Let’s take a step
back. We can analyze the data from your hack without triggering further consequences. We can
create a simulation. Test it. Navigate the risks together.’’

As they discussed their next steps, the room began to hum with a renewed sense of
collaboration. They drew on each other’s strengths, merging Claire’s scientific expertise,
Maya’s creative intuition, and Sophia’s leadership skills. [Psychological] Chris, though
still filled with frustration, felt the warmth of camaraderie seeping back into the frigid
edges of his heart.

With the group united, they set to work, sketching out a plan that combined their talents
with caution. [Environment] As they delved deeper into the mystery of the freeze, the
flickering monitors transformed from harbingers of chaos to beacons of hope, reflecting

the strength found in their shared determination. [Conflict] This moment marked a turning
point|an understanding that every challenge they faced could either drive them apart or forge
unbreakable bonds, and they chose the latter. ...[322 words]...

[Environment] As she finished reading, silence enveloped the room, but it wasn’t the same
tense silence as before. Instead, it felt warm, inviting a space for reflection. Chris
shifted in his seat, his face softening as he took in her words. ‘‘I never thought of it
that way, Maya. I’ve been so focused on the data, on proving myself, that I forgot we’re all
human here, feeling the same fears. It’s easy to hide behind numbers and screens, but I miss
feeling connected.’’ ...[54 words]...

[Psychological] Claire felt a wave of relief wash over her as she realized the significance
of Maya’s honesty. ‘‘This is what I’ve been trying to express. Our emotional journeys are
just as important as our scientific ones. If we want to move forward, we need to create a

safe space where we can be open with each other. We’re not just colleagues; we’re a team that
needs to lean on one another.’’ ...[292 words]...

[Environment] As the night deepened, the flickering lights of the makeshift lab cast long
shadows, elongating the figures of Claire Matthews and Dr. Harold Reed as they huddled over
a table strewn with half-filled coffee cups and scattered notes. Outside, the frozen city
of Frosthaven lay still, a haunting reminder of the urgency that fueled their late-night
discourse. The tension from earlier in the evening had dissipated, replaced by a palpable
sense of purpose. ...[714 words]...

[Environment] When they finally stepped away from the table, the energy in the room felt
charged, like the calm before a storm of creativity and collaboration. Claire turned to
Dr. Reed, her eyes glinting with determination. ‘‘Let’s bring this to the team. I believe
together, we can thaw the emotional freeze and reignite the spirit of Frosthaven.’’



As they prepared to share their newfound idea at the next meeting, [Psychological] Claire
felt a thrill of anticipation and the kindling of unity among her friends. They were not just
researchers anymore; they were storytellers, artists, and empathizers|ready to weave the rich
tapestry of their experiences into the heart of their mission. This chapter in their journey
marked not just a scientific inquiry, but the dawning of a renewed sense of community, where
every voice mattered, and every story echoed with purpose.

Chapter 4: Frozen Reflections

As the group settled into the warmth of their makeshift retreat, the ambiance was both somber
and reflective. [Environment] The room, dimly lit by flickering candles, held remnants of
their earlier discussions|a few sketches from Maya, hastily written notes from Tommy, and a
whiteboard filled with diagrams and equations. Outside, the silent city of Frosthaven loomed,
a ghostly reminder of their shared plight.

Claire shifted uneasily in her seat, glancing at the others. Her heart raced as she sensed

the stories hovering just beneath the surface, waiting to be shared. ‘*‘You know,’’ she began,
her voice soft yet steady, ‘‘we all ended up here for a reason. But sometimes I wonder|what
choices brought us to this frozen moment?’’ ...[{1474 words]...

[Conflict] ‘‘We can’t just keep talking about feelings and art! We need a solid plan if we
want any chance of reversing the anomaly. The science is what matters right now, not these
sentimental projects!’’ His words cut through the room, sharp and jarring against the hopeful
energy.

[Conflict] Maya, taken aback, responded defensively, ‘‘Chris, this is part of the plan! If we
don’t connect emotionally as a team, how can we expect to tackle the scientific challenges?
You’re dismissing what we’re trying to build!’’

[Conflict] Tommy, feeling the tension crackle in the air, hesitated between the two

perspectives. ‘‘*But we’ve seen that our emotions influence our work. If we don’t acknowledge
that, we might just be running in circles. We need this... connection. It’s what makes us
human.’ ’

Conflict] Chris shook his head vehemently. ‘‘Humanity is what got us into this mess! We need

to focus on the cold, hard facts if we want to get out of it!’’

Psychological] The argument escalated, voices rising as frustration spilled over. Claire’s
heart raced; she could feel the rift growing within the group, the very thing they had
fought to overcome beginning to crack. In this moment of chaos, she felt a familiar pang of
loneliness, as if the very silence outside had crept into their hearts and taken hold.

Then, just as it seemed the discussion might devolve into a shouting match, Sophia, who had
been quietly observing, interjected with a calm yet authoritative presence.

Conflict] ‘‘*Enough!’’ she said, her voice steady and clear, cutting through the tension like
a knife. All eyes turned to her, the room falling silent. ‘‘This isn’t about one approach
being more valid than another. We are all here because we want to overcome the anomaly
together, and we need each other to do that. What we’re creating is not just art; it’s a
representation of our collective journey. Each of us is valid, and so are our emotions and
our scientific inquiries.’’ ...[98 words]...

[Resolution] Sophia stepped closer, her gaze steady. ‘‘And I understand that fear. It’s real
for all of us. But remember, fear can’t be the only driver of our actions. We need to harness
that fear and turn it into something constructive. Let’s combine our strengths. Can we agree
to collaborate on both the art and the science? This isn’t about choosing one over the other;
it’s about integrating everything we have at our disposal.’’

[Resolution] The honesty in her words began to soften the resolve in Chris’s expression.
*“*So, you’re saying we can use the art as a means to inform our research?’’


[Resolution] ‘‘*Exactly!’’ Maya chimed in, her voice rising with newfound enthusiasm. ‘‘If we
visualize our findings, it could help make the data more relatable|accessible|especially to
the community. We can overlay the emotional narratives we’ve discussed with the scientific
data we gather. It’ll be a full-bodied representation of our journey.’’

With Sophia’s leadership reestablished, the group began to nod in agreement. [Psychological]
Claire felt the tension ease, the flickering candlelight dancing around them now feeling warm
instead of ominous. ...[45 words]..

[Resolution] As they shifted their focus back to their collaborative project, Claire’s

heart swelled with gratitude for Sophia’s ability to unify them. They moved forward,
sketching ideas and generating plans that would seamlessly weave together their emotional and
scientific pursuits. The earlier argument faded into the background, replaced by a renewed
sense of purpose. They were a team once more, ready to tackle the challenges that lay ahead
together.

[Psychological] In that moment, Claire felt the weight of isolation lift, realizing that they
weren’t just fighting against the freeze; they were fighting for each other. United, they
would explor very avenue to thaw not only the city but the connections that had brought
them together in this frozen time.

Chapter 5: Thawing Resilience

[Environment] The atmosphere in the makeshift lab was thick with anticipation as Claire stood
before her assembled team, a faint hum of energy pulsing through the air. The walls, adorned
with sketches and diagrams born from their collective efforts, felt alive with possibility.
[Psychological] Each of them had poured their hearts into this moment, and now, standing at
the precipice of discovery, Claire could feel the weight of their shared hopes resting on her
shoulders.

‘“*‘Alright, everyone, let’s gather around,’’ Claire called out, her voice steady despit

the flutter of anxiety in her chest. A mix of determination and vulnerability glimmered

in her eyes as she gestured to the whiteboard littered with equations and emotional notes.
‘“*T’ve been thinking about our last discussion|how we need to merge th motional with the
scientific. It’s time we made that a reality.’’ ...[1697 words]...

‘“‘Okay, let’s do this,’’ Chris announced, his voice steadying the group as he clicked the
final command. [Environment] The monitors blinked to life, displaying a flurry of colors and
patterns that mirrored their emotional states.

[Environment] At first, the screen showed a chaotic mix of reds and blues|confusion and

fear swirling together. But as the simulation progressed, the colors began to shift, slowly
transforming into vibrant hues of green and gold. [Psychological] Claire’s heart raced as she
realized what was happening: the emotional resonance they had captured was beginning to have
a tangible effect on the anomaly. ...[272 words]...

[Environment] As the team took a collective breath, the thawing in the city continued, their
newfound awareness grounding them even as they reveled in the joy of discovery. With each
passing moment, the icy grip on Frosthaven began to wane, revealing glimpses of life that had
been frozen in time.

Claire turned to her team, a fierce determination igniting in her. ‘*Let’s document
