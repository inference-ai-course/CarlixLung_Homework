Abstract

Legal practice is intrinsically rooted in the
fabric of language, yet legal practitioners and
scholars have been slow to adopt tools from nat-
ural language processing (NLP). At the same
time, the legal system is experiencing an access
to justice crisis, which could be partially allevi-
ated with NLP. In this position paper, we argue
that the slow uptake of NLP in legal practice is
exacerbated by a disconnect between the needs
of the legal community and the focus of NLP
researchers. In a review of recent trends in the
legal NLP literature, we find limited overlap
between the legal NLP community and legal
academia. Our interpretation is that some of the
most popular legal NLP tasks fail to address
the needs of legal practitioners. We discuss
examples of legal NLP tasks that promise to
bridge disciplinary disconnects and highlight
interesting areas for legal NLP research that
remain underexplored.

1 Introduction

Rapid advances in NLP technology are already
promising to transform society and the econ-
omy (see e.g., OpenAL, 2023; Eloundou et al., 2023;
Bommasani et al., 2021), not least by their impact
on many professions. Given that legal practice is
embedded in written language, it stands to gain
immensely from the application of NLP techniques.
This promise has attracted research on NLP ap-
plications related to a wide array of legal tasks
including legal research (Huang et al., 2021; Os-
tendorff et al., 2021), legal reasoning (Guha et al.,
2023; Mahari, 2021), contract review (Hendrycks
et al., 2021; Leivaditi et al., 2020), statutory inter-
pretation (Nyarko and Sanga, 2022; Savelka et al.,
2019), document review (Yang et al., 2022; Zou
and Kanoulas, 2020), and legal question answer-
ing (Vold and Conrad, 2021; Khazaeli et al., 2021;
Martinez-Gil, 2023).

The current model of legal services is failing
to address legal needs in several important con-

texts. In the United States, around 92% of civil
legal problems experienced by low-income Amer-
icans receive no or inadequate legal help (Slosar,
2022). In U.S. criminal cases, where criminal de-
fendants generally have a right to legal counsel,
public defenders are systematically overworked
and under-resourced (Pace et al., 2023). Access to
legal services is also limited for U.S. small busi-
nesses (Baxter, 2022). The combination of unequal
access to and high costs of legal services results in
a troubling access to justice issue.

Internationally, there is tremendous variation in
legal systems and challenges, but many opportu-
nities where technology could help address legal
inefficiencies and under-served communities have
been identified globally (see e.g., Wilkins et al.,
2017; Cunha et al., 2018; Bosio, 2023; World Jus-
tice Project, 2019). Against this backdrop, numer-
ous scholars have focused on legal technology as a
path towards reducing the access to justice gap by
extending the abilities of legal professionals and
helping non-lawyers navigate legal processes (Bax-
ter, 2022; Bommasani et al., 2021; Cabral et al.,
2012; Rhode, 2013; Katz et al., 2021).

Of course, technology is no panacea and many
of the inequities and inefficiencies in jurisprudence
are related to deeply rooted social and cultural phe-
nomena. Nonetheless, we view the responsible
deployment of legal technology as a crucial step
towards improving the legal profession and broad-
ening access to legal services.

Despite their potential to improve the provision
of legal services, the legal industry has been slow
to adopt computational techniques. The majority
of legal services continue to rely heavily on manual
work performed by highly trained human lawyers.
This slow adoption may be partially attributed to
risk aversion, misaligned incentives, and a lack of
expertise within the legal community (Livermore
and Rockmore, 2019; Fagan, 2020).

We argue that there is another factor to blame,


rooted not in legal practice but rather in legal
NLP research: In short, legal NLP is failing to
develop many applications that would be useful for
lawyers. Instead, legal NLP research tends to focus
on generic NLP tasks and applies widely-used NLP
methodologies to legal data, rather than developing
new NLP tools and approaches that solve problems
unique to the legal context.

For example, NLP research might apply text clas-
sification to predict the direction of a U.S. Supreme
Court judgment based on portions of the judicial
opinion. These types of models tend to be of lim-
ited practical utility: First, the vast majority of
lawyers and legal disputes will never reach the
Supreme Court. Second, the legal reasoning ap-
plied by the Supreme Court is unlikely to be rep-
resentative of lower courts. And lastly, classifiers
trained on published judgments may emulate judi-
cial idiosyncrasies rather than modeling optimal
legal reasoning. Meanwhile, there has been less
research on systems to help lawyers identify rel-
evant precedent for trial, on exploring automated
summarization and generation of legal documents,
or leveraging NLP for online dispute resolution.

The work done by Livermore and Rockmore
(2019); Katz et al. (2021); Cabral et al. (2012);
Rhode (2013) and others takes an important step
toward bridging disciplinary disconnects by pro-
viding overviews of NLP and related methods to
legal and multidisciplinary communities. We hope
to build on this work by encouraging the legal NLP
community to understand the needs of legal prac-
titioners. Our paper offers some initial starting
points for NLP research that are informed by prac-
tical needs.

We base our argument on a review of recent le-
gal NLP research, which identifies key themes in
this literature (see Figure 1). We find that a large
portion of this research focuses on tasks which we
believe are disconnected from the needs of legal
practitioners. We further observe that only a small
fraction of citations to legal NLP publications stem
from legal publications, providing evidence that
NLP publications have not managed to rise to the
attention of the legal community (see left panel
of Figure 2). Grounded in this review, we seg-
ment legal NLP tasks into three categories: applica-
tions that could aid the provision of legal services;
widespread NLP applications that have limited im-
pact on practical legal issues; and areas of legal
NLP research that could have significant impact on

legal practice but which remain underexplored.
Our work adds to a growing number of recent
position papers discussing the intersection of law

and NLP (see e.g., Dale, 2019; Zhong et al., 2020;

Tsarapatsanis and Aletras, 2021; de Oliveira et al.,

2022; Katz et al., 2023). The number of survey

papers in this domain might suggest some confu-

sion about the state of legal NLP. In addition to

offering descriptive findings, we aim to provide a

normative argument. In light of the access to jus-

tice issues highlighted above, we encourage legal

NLP researchers to pragmatically focus on work

that promises to broaden access to justice. This

objective helps advance a shared normative goal
that does not neglect the ‘legal’ dimension of legal

NLP.

To summarize, we make the following contribu-
tions and recommendations.

(1) We review the current state of legal NLP.

(2) We discuss underexplored areas of legal NLP
research.

(3) We propose the use of legal NLP to tackle the
access to justice crisis as a shared normative
goal.

(4) We advocate for more collaboration between
NLP researchers and legal scholars and practi-
tioners.

2 Literature Review

We conduct a rapid literature review via forward
citation chasing over 171 papers, following rec-
ommendations made by Khangura et al. (2012).
Literature reviews have been employed in several
position papers investigating the intersection of
NLP and other disciplines (see e.g., Laureate et al.,
2023; Ricketts et al., 2023).

The starting point of our rapid review is Zhong

et al. (2020), an overview paper about how legal
NLP benefits the legal system. We selected this
work as our starting point because it is a recent
contribution in a top NLP conference that has re-
ceived a reasonably high number of citations for
us to review. Moreover, it provides (to the best of
our knowledge) a fairly accurate overview about
the current state of legal NLP. Our review includes
all papers citing Zhong et al. (2020) on Google
Scholar.

Zhong et al. (2020) aim to identify popular legal
NLP tasks and discuss these tasks from the perspec-
tives of legal professionals. Tasks outlined in the
paper include legal judgment prediction, question
answering, and similar case matching.

We read and manually annotate all papers cit-
ing Zhong et al. (2020), resulting in 171 annotated
papers.! For each paper, we determine:

(1) Is the paper is mainly a NLP contribution, an
interdisciplinary contribution, or a legal contri-
bution?

(2) What are the paper’s key objectives (e.g., legal
judgment prediction, summarization, position
paper, introducing a benchmark)? A paper can
have multiple objectives.

We follow a hybrid inductive-deductive content
analysis methodology, employed in Birhane et al.
(2022), and aim to follow best practices and recom-
mendations from the qualitative content analysis lit-
erature (see e.g., Merriam and Grenier, 2019; Krip-
pendorff, 2018; Hsieh and Shannon, 2005; Bengts-
son, 2016).

We start with a set of ten objectives described
in Zhong et al. (2020), such as relation extraction,

"At the time of writing, the paper had 182 citations in total.
We discarded nine citations for which Google Scholar did not
provide a link.

legal judgment prediction and question answering.
We list all of these in Appendix A. If a paper de-
scribes an objective that cannot be classified into
one of these categories, we define a new category.
After every 20 annotations, we review all categories
assigned so far and decide whether to merge exist-
ing categories (e.g., named entity recognition and
semantic role labeling merge into information ex-
traction, while similar case matching and semantic
search merge into information retrieval) — this rep-
resents the deductive step in our approach. After
annotating all 171 papers, we review all categories
again and perform a final merge. Finally, for each
paper, we determine whether it is a legal, NLP, or
interdisciplinary publication. This categorization
is based on the publication venue and the author’s
affiliations.

We display our main findings in Figure 2. We
find that despite the inherently interdisciplinary
nature of legal NLP, most work we reviewed is pro-
duced and consumed by the NLP community. Only
10% of the papers citing Zhong et al. (2020) are pri-
marily interdisciplinary. Perhaps more strikingly,
only a single law review article cites Zhong et al.
(2020). In terms of paper objectives, we find that
legal judgment prediction appears to be the most
popular objective, with 20% of reviewed papers
focusing on this task.

3 Categorizing legal NLP applications

Based on our review, we categorize popular legal
NLP objectives in terms of their ability to impact
the practice of law or broaden access to justice.
Subsequently, we identify potentially impactful ar-
eas of research that remain underexplored.


3.1 Existing applications that promise to aid
legal practitioners

We identify three primary streams of legal NLP
research that promise to benefit legal practice and
improve access to justice.

Legal document generation and analysis. NLP
technology can help speed up drafting, e.g., via ded-
icated legal language models or general-purpose
language models such as GPT-4. It can also help
analyze legal documents, for example via informa-
tion extraction or summarization (Galgani et al.,
2012; Bommarito II et al., 2021). Based on a sur-
vey of senior attorneys (see Appendix B), we note
that document review and generation appear to be
critical tasks from the perspective of many practi-
tioners.

Semantic search. Legal arguments rely heavily
on citations to statutes and precedential court opin-
ions. Several scholars have thus focused on de-
signing systems that aid attorneys in finding cita-
tions to prior court decisions that support their ar-
guments (Huang et al., 2021; Tang and Clematide,
2021).

Accessibility of legal language. The translation
of legal jargon into more accessible forms has been
identified as an important priority by legal schol-
ars (Benson, 1984). Here, style transfer methods,
legal summarization, question answering and infor-
mation extraction methods can all prove helpful to
make legal language more accessible and to sur-
face key concepts (see e.g., Farzindar and Lapalme,
2004; Manor and Li, 2019; Khazaeli et al., 2021).
These applications can help judges quickly under-
stand filings submitted by attorneys, aid lawyers in
gaining an overview of documents, and can help
individuals better understand contracts, wills and
other documents that may be relevant to them.

3.2 Applications that fail to aid legal
practitioners

Some legal NLP publications focus on tasks that
are simply not part of legal practice or that use
legal data in ways that do not fully account for how
this data was generated. Other publications focus
on tasks with significant ethical implications that
make them ill-suited for real-world deployment.
Legal judgment prediction (LJP), the most com-
mon task identified in our review, suffers from both
of these weaknesses. First, LJP typically extracts
facts from court opinions and then uses the facts

to predict the associated judgment. This approach
is problematic because the narrative presented by
judges in their opinions is typically crafted with an
outcome in mind, thereby precluding neutrality in
the facts they present. As such, LJP treats human-
generated annotations as ground truths when in
fact these annotations are based on confounding
factors. Moreover, the automation of legal judg-
ments is fraught with ethical challenges. Biased
judgments would have grave social implications,
not only for litigants directly affected by inaccurate
legal judgments but also society at large if auto-
mated judgments undermine trust in the judicial
system. LJP may have utility for low-stakes dis-
putes that may not otherwise see a day in court,
or it could be used to simulate a specific judge’s
or court’s idiosyncrasies, which may be a helpful
strategic tool for potential litigants. Furthermore,
LJP might also be useful to surface existing biases
in judicial decision making. However, LJP is typi-
cally framed as modeling the “correct” application
of laws to facts. Due to its inherent risks, this ap-
plication should be carefully considered and it is
unlikely to materialize in the near future, if at all.
It is important to underscore that other common
legal NLP tasks may not directly aid legal practi-
tioners, but nevertheless provide valuable resources
and insights. These include detecting bias in legal
language (Rice et al., 2019) and legal NLP bench-
marks which help measure the progress of NLP
methods (Chalkidis et al., 2022; Guha et al., 2023).

3.3. Underexplored applications that promise
to aid legal practitioners

Understanding the nature of legal practice in more
detail can help surface applications of NLP that
would be useful to legal practitioners. Of course,
this is easier said than done as there are still lim-
ited opportunities for legal NLP researchers and
legal practitioners to exchange ideas. For this dis-
cussion, we draw partially on a survey conducted
as part of Harvard Law School’s 2023 Leadership
in Law Firms program (LLF). This survey asked
over 50 senior attorneys from 17 different coun-
tries to identify potentially impactful applications
of NLP which would provide value in their firms
(see Appendix B for an overview of responses).

"We recognize that these responses are not representative
of legal practice generally, but present them as a valuable
example of how practitioners think about NLP and as a starting
point for ideation.


Persuasive legal reasoning. Litigation is at least
partially a rhetorical exercise in which attorneys
seek to identify the most persuasive arguments
while taking into account the presiding judge and,
in some instances, the composition of the jury. The
nature of litigation offers ample opportunity for
the study of language in general, and the study
of discourse and pragmatics specifically. Extrane-
ous factors, like the presiding judge, have a sig-
nificant impact on the persuasiveness of different
arguments, and there already exists NLP research
on context-aware argumentation (see e.g. Durmus
et al., 2019) that could be applied to law.

Practice-oriented legal research tools. Legal re-
search and case analysis was one of the key areas
identified in the LLF Survey. In common law juris-
dictions, law develops organically through judicial
opinions and higher courts may overturn or refine
past court decisions. Legal research platforms la-
bel whether a case is considered “good law’, that
is whether it remains a good basis for future ar-
guments and thus current law. Current citation
prediction work has largely ignored this aspect, cre-
ating a risk that outdated or overturned opinions
are recommended. NLP research techniques such
as sentiment analysis could identify how a citation
is used by judges to determine whether it remains
good law.

A related extension is the retrieval of individual
legal passages. Judicial opinions are generally long
documents and legal practitioners normally cite
very specific passages. As a result, legal research
platforms often present specific passages as “head
notes” or “key cites” to allow lawyers and judges
to identify the most important portions of opinions.
Legal passage prediction (LPP) seeks to predict spe-
cific passages, rather than entire judicial opinions,
which is more closely aligned with the needs of
legal professionals (Mahari, 2021). LPP may also
be combined with extractive summarization (see
e.g. Bauer et al., 2023), to identify passages from
an opinion that are most likely to represent useful
citations.

Retrieval augmented generation over private le-
gal data. A more general opportunity for legal
NLP is related to proprietary legal data. Law firms
amass large knowledge banks from past cases that
contain sensitive and confidential data. Practicing
attorneys routinely build on their past work and
experience. NLP tools could help them identify rel-

evant records and, based on these retrieved records,
generate new documents. Retrieval augmented
generation (see e.g. Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud
et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023) is well suited to this
task, however, it is critical that confidential records
are not leaked to external parties or other public
databases (Arora et al., 2023), and that generation
is performed in an auditable fashion (Mahari et al.,
2023).

4 Discussion

The disconnect between AI research on applica-
tions and specific disciplines is not limited to
law (see e.g. Acosta et al., 2022). Law, however, is
unique among disciplines in that it is a field built on
language. Given the current state of legal practice,
there is a need for innovation to make legal services
more affordable and to address the access to justice
crisis. As such, law presents a valuable opportunity
for the NLP community to conduct research on ap-
plications that could aid legal practitioners and that
expand access to justice.

Impactful legal NLP research must be grounded
in the needs of the legal community. The observed
lack of cross-disciplinary citations in our review
suggests that legal NLP researchers are largely dis-
connected from the legal community. We encour-
age legal NLP researchers to identify tasks that
are performed frequently by legal practitioners and
that lend themselves to the application of NLP tech-
niques. To aid NLP researchers in identifying these
tasks, we urge them to consider closer interdisci-
plinary collaborations with the legal community or
at least to address legal issues identified in the legal
literature.

5 Conclusion

By leveraging a literature review, we find that the
legal NLP community is largely disconnected from
legal academia. We emphasize that certain popular
legal NLP tasks are only of limited utility to legal
practitioners. We thus urge legal NLP researchers
to focus on access to justice as a shared norma-
tive objective, to ground their work in the needs
of the legal community, and to consider collabo-
rating with lawyers to ensure that their research
has applications in practice. NLP has the poten-
tial to positively transform the practice of law and
by extension society. However, this is impossible
without cross-disciplinary understanding and col-
laboration.


Limitations

Business applications. Reviews of NLP litera-
ture provide insight into academic work, but they
do not reveal business applications of NLP. While
we observe a disconnect between NLP research
and law in academia, it is possible that there ex-
ists unpublished work that is more attuned to the
needs of the legal community. However, this work
tends to focus on profitable applications, which are
not always aligned with broadening access to jus-
tice. The LLF survey provides a business-oriented
perspective by surveying senior attorneys from an
international group of law firms, however, more ex-
haustive work is needed to fully understand where
NLP tools provide value to law firms and to what
degree these offerings also address access to justice
issues.

Scope. We conduct a rapid review based on cita-
tions to a popular NLP paper. Our intuitions about
the field lead us to believe that our findings extrap-
olate to the field as a whole. Contemporaneous
work provides a broader overview and identifies
similar trends as our review. For example, Katz
et al. (2023) find that classification is the most pop-
ular objective in the legal NLP community (LJP
represents a classification task). While our work is
similar in spirit to Katz et al. (2023), we take a less
descriptive but more normative approach.

Ethics Statement

If aligned with societal needs, legal NLP has
tremendous potential to expand access to justice, to
reduce biases in legal practice, and to create new ef-
ficiencies in legal practice. At the same time, legal
NLP deals with a sensitive aspect of society. Poorly
designed NLP tools could embed biases, remove
human oversight, or undermine trust in the legal
system. Our hope is that encouraging collaboration
between NLP and legal researchers will also help
identify and mitigate ethical challenges.

Broader Impact. This publication is a perspec-
tive about the current state of legal NLP and its
future directions, grounded in evidence about inter-
disciplinary disconnects. Of course, the trajectory
of an academic field ought to be based on delibera-
tive discussions involving many stakeholders. We
present our recommendations and visions about the
future of legal NLP, which are, at least to some
extent, subjective. We invite others to expand on
and to critique our views and hope to contribute to

a broad and thoughtful discussion about the future
of legal NLP.

B_ Harvard Leadership in Law Firms:
Survey Responses

As part of Harvard Law School’s Leadership in
Law Firms program, the lead author of this pa-
per conducted a survey of over 50 senior attorneys
from 17 different countries on applications of NLP
in legal practice. The survey asked: What is one
legal-related task (e.g., document review, respond-
ing to a motion), system (e.g., time entry or giving
feedback), type of legal matter (deals, regulatory
review) that you would LOVE for generative Al to
make easier/more efficient?

While by no means representative of the legal
industry as a whole, the survey responses provide
valuable insight into the priorities of practicing
attorneys. As such, they serve as a starting point
for some new avenues of legal NLP research and
an example of how the research community can
solicit insights from practitioners.

At a high level, the following application cate-
gories emerged from the survey:

(1) Legal and business document review and sum-
marization (42/59)

(2) Time entry and billing, case intake, and review-
ing invoices (14/59)

(3) Case law research and regulatory review
(11/59)

(4) Legal document generation, creating multi-
document summaries (3/59)

(5) Simulating or predicting legal outcomes (2/59)
(6) Project and process management (2/59)
(7) Knowledge management (1/59)
