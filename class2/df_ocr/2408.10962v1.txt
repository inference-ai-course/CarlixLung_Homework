ABSTRACT

English language is in the spotlight of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community with
other languages, like Greek, lagging behind in terms of offered methods, tools and resources. Due
to the increasing interest in NLP, in this paper we try to condense research efforts for the automatic
processing of Greek language covering the last three decades. In particular, we list and briefly discuss
related works, resources and tools, categorized according to various processing layers and contexts.
We are not restricted to the modern form of Greek language but also cover Ancient Greek and various
Greek dialects. This survey can be useful for researchers and students interested in NLP tasks,
Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management for the Greek language.

1 Introduction

There is a wide variety of methods, tools and resources for processing text in the English language. However this is not
the case for the Greek language even though it has a long documented history spanning at least 3,400 years of written
records (including texts in syllabic script), and 28 centuries (Archaic period - new) of written text with alphabet [I] [2].
The over 2500 years literary tradition of Greek is also notable. To aid those that are interested in using, developing
or advancing the techniques for Greek processing, in this paper we survey related works and resources organized in
categories. We hope this collection and categorization of works to be useful for students and researchers interested in
NLP tasks, Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management for the Greek language. Indeed, there is an everlasting
and vivid discussion on how computational tools can help in the study and research of Greek texts starting from the rich
production of Ancient Greek literary work (31 (4) [5] (6) (7) ending with Modern Greek and the various Greek dialects.

Modern Greek is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages, the sole descendant of Ancient
Greek. It is the official language in Greece and one of the two official languages in Cyprus (along with Turkish). There
are Greek-speaking enclaves in Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Romania, Georgia, Ukraine, Lebanon,
Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey. The Greek language is also spoken by a significant number of people belonging to
Greek diaspora i.e., communities of people with Greek origin living outside of Greece and Cyprus. Such Grecophone
communities exist in USA, e.g., Tarpon Springs, Astoria, Australia e.g., Melbourne, Canada, Germany, the United
Kingdom and in other countries too.

A few characteristics or particularities of the Greek language that make some NLP tasks challenging, follow. Greek
words are typically polysyllabic with function words to be usually shorter than content words [8]. There is a highly
consistent alphabetic orthography with minor complexities [9]. Morphology is a developed component in the grammar
of Greek since it exhibits productive word-formation patterns for both derivation e.g., suffixation, prefixation and
compounding [10]. It has an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, whereas the rich productivity of compounds
stems from a relatively limited system of compounding. Greek is a language highly inflected based predominantly
on suffixes but there are also few infixes and one inflectional prefix. There are many different suffixes in the nominal
system due to the number (singular and plural), the four cases (nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative), the three
genders i.e., masculine, feminine and neuter, let alone irregular formations. Case, number and gender are marked on


NLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024

the noun as well as on articles and adjectives modifying it. Verb in turn have two different stems (imperfective and
perfective), while there are several cases of irregular verbs.

In terms of syntax, Greek language has a fairly free word order and it is a null-subject language (e.g., the phrase “Jason
has started" can be expressed in Greek both as “O Iécovac Eextvnoe", and “Zextvyoe." depending on the context) [LI].
Other characteristic features of the language are: the clitic doubling (a tendency to use pre-verbal clitic object pronouns
redundantly e.g., “I gave Maria the sweets" /“(Tyc) (ta) edmoa thc Maptac ta yAuxé& ", “I show John" / “(Tov)
elda (tov Tidvvn)) and the lack the lack of a typical infinitive. In the course of the years, we observe the merging
of the dative and the genitive case. More specifically, indirect objects are expressed partly through genitive forms of
nouns or pronouns, and partly through a periphrasis consisting of the preposition ce / to while some dative fossils
still remair|'|for example eAAcitbet / in shortage, ex’ avtopmHew / red-handed. Lastly, the nominative and accusative
case syncretism creates interesting ambiguities in sentences like Avateonéc épepay Ta exAoyind anoteAgouata /
The election results brought upheavals.

On the evolution of the language, over the centuries, we could mention that Modern Greek language’s rich vocabulary
has retained many Ancient Greek words either as whole words or as stems. These words have morphologically adapted
to the rules of Modern Greek and also many ancient words have also evolved grammatically or semantically. In terms
of grammar, some of the changes include the loss of the dative case, the loss of the infinitive and the loss of the dual
number [12]. Ancient Greek had verbs while the modern language has verb phrases (analytical forms of verbs). Greek
seems to be affected by both language internal factors and by borrowing from languages it has been in contact with (13).
Most of the older “loans” has been fully adapted to the system of the language while some newer loans mostly from
English and French have remained inact causing difficulties in the computational processing tools. An analytical
description of Modern Greek Grammar can be found in [14].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section[2|describes previous surveys on Greek NLP, and the methodology
that we followed. Section [3|surveys the works on Greek NLP. Section [4] describes some noteworthy resources and
evaluation collections that are available, and finally, Section|[5]concludes the paper.

2 Other surveys and methodology

There are not many papers that attempt to survey this area. We have found the 2010 paper [15], the white paper and
its recent update [I7]]. There is also some surveys about particular topics like that focuses on tools for sentiment
analysis in Greek, that surveys social web datasets for Greek and the applicable mining techniques, that
surveys NLP for the Greek legal domain and that is focused in the healthcare NLP infrastructure for the Greek
Language.

For the Ancient Greek, we found an entry in “Encyclopedia of Ancient Greek Language and Linguistics” that
briefly discusses available digital resources and methods for the processing of Ancient Greek.

The current paper is an expanded and more analytical version of the paper [23]. In comparison to that paper, the current
survey: is more complete in the sense that contained 99 references, while the current paper contains 221 references,
it provides a more rich categorization, and it contains more tables that summarize the available information for aiding
the reader to find out what it is available, As regards the latter, the current paper contains tables that describe the
available (i) domain specific annotated datasets (Table (4p. (ii) embeddings for the Modern Greek (Table[5) and Ancient
Greek (Table|[6) language, (iii) toolkits and their functionality erro and), (iv) tools and related references (Table
9). and (v) tools and resources offered via online interfaces (Table}10).

2.1 Methodology for the current survey

For finding the related works we used Google Scholar, ResearchGate, DBLP, and the ACL Anthology in the period:
April 2020 - December 2022, without any restriction on the publication date. Although we did not used any filter, the
majority of works that we retrieved concerns the last three decades. We started by collecting all papers that contain the
word “Greek” in the title and we used various extra keywords and keyphrases for finding the related papers.

In particular we used the following queries : “Greek" plus one of the following (we list them on alphabetical order and
in lowercase):

“abusive language, anaphora resolution, ancient nlp, ancient, argument extraction, argument mining,
authorship attribution, authorship, chatbot, computational journalism, computational linguistics,
computational pragmatics, computational semantics, computational lexicons, controlled natural

phonology, abusive language, pos, question answering, readability, sentiment analysis, sentiment
lexicons, slang, spelling checkers, stemmers, stemming, summarization, syllabification, syntactic
parsers, syntax, text processing, transformers, transliteration".

Whenever we considered necessary, we expanded our searches in order to find follow-up, more mature works or related
research projects, growing in this way the thread of our searches. A similar process was followed for finding resources
and evaluation collections. The queries were modified accordingly, and apart from the aforementioned sources we also
used general-purpose web search engines.

We did not focus on papers that deal with multilingualism and could potentially contain Greek as well. Consequently,
the survey is by no means complete, however we tried to find the more relevant and fundamental works and resources
for giving a concise overview. However the reader must be aware and keep an eye also on approaches like transfer
learning, distant supervision and data augmentation since they can be of great benefit on NLP tasks in the absence of
resources [25]. In the sections that follow when we refer to Ancient Greek, we mean the historical language as
determined in the ISO 639-3 code set classification with language index gr] The usual cutoff for this distinction is the
date of 1453 (the Fall of Constantinople).

Later, in Section[3.2} we provide the time distribution of the examined papers.

3 Survey of works on Greek NLP

At first, in Section 3.1] we provide a categorization of the various NLP tasks (shown in Figure|1). Then, in Section[3.2|
we provide a quantitative overview of the surveyed works. The rest subsections, from Section}3.3}to Section[3.14] are
based on the categorization introduced in Section[3.2] Tables [2|and 3]that are embedded in Section|3}summarize works
in POS tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER) respectively.

3.1 Categorization

In this survey we group the available works according to various processing layers and contexts, namely: object
character recognition (§3.3), phonetics (§3.4), morphology (§3.5), syntax (§3.6), embeddings ($3.7), semantics ({3.8),
pragmatics ($3.9), sentiment analysis ($3.10), question answering (§3-Tip, natural language generation ($3.12), machine
translation ($3.13). An overview of the topics that are addressed (up to some degree) is given in Figure

However we also include a section that refers to works that capture several layers, as well as sections on related
topics ($3.14), including dialect detection, lip reading, Greek sign language, keyword spotting, argument mining,
computational journalism, health domain, crowd-sourcing, metaphor detection, irony detection, genre identification,
fake news detection, legal domain, authorship, education - analytics, controlled natural languages. Resources and
evaluation collections are described afterwards, in Section|[4]

We are aware that a work may fit to more than one category, however we have decided to avoid duplicates. We have
also decided to avoid the inclusion of quantitative results because such numbers would not be comparable since in
most cases they are based on experiments over different collections (the interested user can refer to the mentioned
papers for quantitative results). The works in each section are described in chronological order. Whenever it was more
sensible we also grouped some papers thematically. Note also that some works or projects have been published in more
than one paper. In such cases we include one of these works; the interested reader could perform more searches to
find subsequent or related works through the usual channels (e.g., google scholar, dblp, authors’ pages or pages of the
organizations they are affiliated to) since it is impossible this survey to be exhaustive. As regards distribution in time,
Figure [I]also shows the year intervals of the found works by category.

To aid the understanding of the categorization and the output of the basic NLP tasks,

Figure[2|shows a small and typical NLP example, i.e., a small Greek phrase, specifically “O ApiototéAng, etde thy
XOTEA UE TO THAcoxXOTLO” (Aristotle saw the girl with the telescope), and how the results of some basic NLP tasks
might be.

Figure 1: Categorization of works in the survey enriched with the publication year of the oldest work per category that
we have included in this survey.

Notice the various ambiguities that exist: “Aristotle” could refer either to the ancient philosopher, or to Aristotle Onassis
(Greek shipping magnate), or even to a modern person, while the phrase “with the telescope” may refer to “saw” (1.e.,
Aristotle saw the girl through his telescope) or to “girl” (e.g., Aristotle saw the girl carrying her telescope), exhibiting a
kind of syntactic ambiguity i.e., prepositional phrase (PP) attachment.

Of course, there are many other types of ambiguities and challenges that computational processing tools must grasp.
The free word order can pose some difficulties since even this simple utterance can be formed in various alternative
ways giving emphasis on different parts (e.g. the above phrase could be formed as ”tnv xonéAa We TO THAEOXOTLO
e(de o AptototéAnc”). In addition, the clitic doubling (e.g. expressing the above utterance as ”tnv xonéha UE TO
THAcoxOmo tHy elde o AptototéAyc”), and the pro-drop feature must be also taken into account in tasks like syntactic
parsing, machine translation, natural language generation, coreference resolution etc.

Such ambiguities make the general objective of NLU (Natural Language Understanding) very challenging. We can
understand the intended meaning(s) only by considering (and properly analyzing) the context of the text.

3.2 Quantitative Overview

A few questions that we have had at the beginning were: (a) what is the distribution of papers per year, (b) how the
number of papers about Ancient Greek compares with those about Modern Greek?, and (c) does the zest for the advance
of Greek NLP is only a matter of researchers and institutions residing in Greece? Table[i}]shows the distribution in
decades of the papers mentioned in this survey. We have split the last decade in two rows (corresponding to 5 and 7
years respectively) to make clear the trend. We have observed: (i) a significant overall increase over the last years,
(ii) an increase in works based on neural networks, (iii) a relatively high number of papers on sentiment analysis with
specialized solutions for the Greek language, and (iv) an emerging interest for dialogue systems. Another interesting
remark is that we found more works about Ancient Greek than we expected, 19% of the works that we found concerns
Ancient Greek.

As regards to the origin of the authors of these works we noticed a clear distinction between studies about Ancient Greek
and Modern Greek. Most of the studies referring to the Modern Greek language originated from Greek universities and
institutions with some exceptions i.e., the work in [26], plus three master theses [27], and [29], that are conducted
abroad. In contrast, the authors of works related to Ancient Greek are affiliated with organizations outside Greece. It is

With respect to the time period when a topic is first introduced in the literature, Figure[I|presents the topic categorization
enriched with year intervals.

Another interesting question, is how many papers concern each particular topic. Such counts can be construed as
indicators of how much/well a topic has been elaborated in the literature. In addition, they enable the reader to identify
gaps and directions that have not been explored so far. To this end, Figure [3|shows how many papers occur in the
corresponding subsection sorted in descending order.

We can observe that the most frequent topics are: syntax/POS tagging, morphology and sentiment analysis. The same
information is presented as a tree map in Figure/4| Finally, Figure |5|shows the number of papers per topic, but for
Ancient Greek only.

3.3 Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) refers to the process of converting images of typed, handwritten or printed text
into machine-readable text.

3.3.1 Ancient Greek

We have identified three works about OCR over Ancient Greek.

30] focus on the problem of recognizing old Greek manuscripts and propose a segmentation-free recognition technique
tested in historical manuscript collections which are written in lowercase letters and originate from St. Catherine’s
Mount Sinai Monastery.

[31] describes a process for training the open-source Tesseract OCR engine |https://github.com/tesseract-ocr

to support Ancient Greek. One of the challenges in this work is the recognition of the two types of diacritical
marks of Ancient Greek, breathing marks and accents.

focus on large-scale optical character recognition of ancient (or polytonic) Greek; the approach is based on the

Gamera framework |https://gamera. informatik.hsnr.de/index.htm1], and they report results from processing

1,200 volumes comprising about 330 million Greek words.

3.3.2 Modern Greek

[33] and describe methods for Greek handwritten character recognition evaluated over handwritten character and
digit databases. In the first one a hybrid feature extraction scheme was employed, while in the second one the extraction
is based on recursive subdivisions of the character image so that the resulting sub-images at each iteration have balanced
(approximately equal) numbers of foreground pixels.

present an approach for the recognition of Greek polytonic scripts by training and testing a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based recognizer using the OCRopus framework |https://github.com/tmbarchive/ocropy].

In this context, the authors created the publicly available database Polyton-DB that extends the previous GRPOLY-
DB consisting of scanned pages only. The Polyton-DB contains 15,689 textlines of synthetic and authentic printed
Greek polytonic script.

describe the design and development of an OCR tool for the recognition of Greek printed polytonic scripts. The
proposed framework includes the whole process including data gathering and structuring, OCR tool development, user
interface development, experiments on the training procedure of the tool, evaluation, post-correction and quality control
of the results.

3.3.3 Endangered dialects

develop an OCR post-correction method tailored for endangered dialects by adopting a sequence-to-sequence
architecture. This work also introduces a benchmark dataset with transcribed images in three endangered languages,
namely Ainu, Griko, and Yakkh. Griko is a Greek dialect spoken in the area of Southern Italy called Grecia

Salentina. All the resources are available at [https://shrutirij.github.io/ocr-el/].

3.4 Phonetics/ Phonology

Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies the sounds of human speech. Phonology is the study of the organization
and function of speech sounds in a given system (language). Although the differences are well-established sometimes
these terms are equated [41].

The 1972 book studies Greek phonology in general, while focuses on the Greek dialect vowel systems.
describes the 2007 state of the art in Greek phonetics.


NLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024

present an algorithm for the generation of intonation (FO contours) for the Greek Text-To-Speech system devel-
oped at Wire Communications Laboratory. analyze the acoustic characteristics of the Greek vowels (duration,
fundamental frequency, amplitude, and others). Along the same line, analyzes the acoustic characteristics of Greek
vowels produced by adults and children. apply a decision-tree based approach for learning Greek phonetic rules.
IPAGreek ((48]) is an implementation (available at [49]]) of Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek “phonological
grammar”. The application enables users to transcribe text written in Greek orthography into the International Phonetics
Alphabet (IPA).

proposes an automatic machine learning (ML) approach that learns rules of how to transcribe Greek words into
the International Phonetics Association’s (IPA’s) phonetic alphabet. describes classification approaches based on
deep neural networks for distinguishing two Greek dialects, namely Athenian Greek, the prototypical form of Standard
Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek. Finally, propose a family of algorithms for phonetic matching for Greek text
, for example the 4 characters length phonemic transcription of

“AoltototeAnc’ 1s “a8 @4”, while the full phonemic transcription is “aristotelis”.

3.5 Morphology

Morphological parsing is the analysis of word structure and it is usually a prerequisite for many text processing tasks.
Indeed, some of the first efforts in processing Greek text were towards the creation of tools for this level of linguistic
analysis [3}{53]. Due to the rich morphology of Greek language, related tasks such the automated lemmatization (i.e.,
the removal of inflectional suffixes for getting the base form of a word), stemming (i.e., the reduction of all the inflected
forms of word into a common canonical form without the need to be meaningful), hyphenation (i.e., splitting a token
over two lines with a hyphen symbol) and spell checking, are challenging.

3.5.1 Ancient Greek

[54] presents a set of rules for the hyphenation of Ancient Greek taking into account characteristics such as the diversity
of compound terms, declension, diacritics as well as special cases in which identical words have different meanings and
different hyphenation. The resulting resource is incorporated in the ScholarTex package [55].

proposes a morphological analyzer that is based on the nearest-neighbor machine learning framework and
does not require hand-crafted rules contrary to previous existing approaches such as in the classical works [3] and [53).
It is also able to predict unseen words and to rerank its predictions by exploiting an unlabelled corpus of Ancient Greek.

investigates the effectiveness of evolutionary computation algorithms in the morphological segmentation of words
into subword segments, focusing on the definition of stems and endings.

describe GLEM, a publicly available lemmatizer |https://github.com/GreekPerspective/glem] for Ancient

Greek that uses POS information for disambiguation. GLEM is able to assign output to unseen words.

https: //github.com/sommerschield/ancient-text-restoration] focus on the recovery of missing characters

from a damaged text input using deep neural networks.

https: //github.com/deepmind/ithacal| is a close-related and follow-up work of that utilizes a deep neural

network trained simultaneously to perform the tasks of textual restoration, geographical attribution and chronological
attribution for ancient Greek inscriptions.

3.5.2. Modern Greek

present the implementation of a morphological processor for the Modern Greek language that is based on the
two-level morphology model introduced by [63].

A rule-based hyphenator has been presented in that derives rules from grammar and phonology, while a few years
later presents hyphenation patterns created for Ancient and Modern Greek to correct mistakes or to complete
patterns previously found on related CTAN (Comprehensive TEX Archive Network) [https://www.ctan.org/] packages.

presents an interactive spelling correction system for Modern Greek. The system is based on a morphological
lexicon and emphasis was given not only on dictionary’s coverage, but also on describing the rich inflectional morphology
of Greek as economically as possible.

https://github.com/skroutz/greek_stemmer| describes a stemmer for the Greek language that follows the

known Porter algorithm for the English language and it is developed according to the grammatical rules of the Greek
language. Along the same line, present a stemmer for the Greek language that follows again an affix removal

approach (as the Porter’s Algorithm). and introduce another stemmer [http://saroukos.com/stemmer


NLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024

for the Greek language and compare it with previous implementations, while provide a stemming and tagging
procedure for the Greek language that can be easily adapted to existing systems.

3.5.3 Endangered dialects

present the design and the implementation process of a tri-dialectal dictionary for three Greek dialects in Asia
Minor, namely Pontic, Cappadocian and Aivaliot.

3.6 POS tagging and syntactic parsing

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging (also called grammatical tagging) is the process of marking up a word in a text as
corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. Syntax concerns the
principles governing the arrangement of words in sentences, clauses and phrases as well as the relations among
these parts [72]. The creation of computational grammars that adapt frameworks from theoretical linguistics and
the part-of-speech tagging, e.g., see an example of such analysis for the word “etde” in the phrase of Figure [2]
are the backbone tasks, as the study of the literature showed. Again the high degree of inflection of the Greek
language can add difficulty in computational approaches. It is indicative that a tagset for the Greek language, e.g.,

http://nlp.ilsp.gr/nlp/tagset_examples/tagset_en/index.htm1|, can be many times larger than that for English,
e.g., Penn Treebank [73].

3.6.1 Ancient Greek

describe the first release of the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank |https://perseusd1. github. io/treebank_
(AGDT), a 190,903-word syntactically annotated corpus of literary texts including the works of Hesiod, Homer

and Aeschylus.
The thesis of describes the implementation of a rule-based POS tagger for Ancient Greek.

compare five statistical POS taggers, i.e., the Mate tagger [77], the Hunpos tagger [78], RFTagger [79], the
OpenNLP POS tagger, and the NLTK Unigram tagger. The data from Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank were
used to train and compare the POS taggers. The results, with respect to the overall accuracy, showed that the Mate
tagger performed better than any other tagger.

Another thesis describes the implementation of a POS-tagger and a lemmatizer by employing traditional machine
learning algorithms i.e., support vector machines (SVM) and Conditional Ranfom Fields (CRF) [82].

describes a dataset comprising a collection of dependency syntax trees of representative texts from ancient
Greek prose authors (Aeschines, Antiphon, Appian, Athenaeus, Demosthenes, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Herodotus,
Josephus, Lysias, Plutarch, Polybius, Thucydides, and Xenophon), totalling to date more than 550,000 tokens.

present a “roadmap” on how different already available treebanks in Ancient Greek, namely Perseus Ancient
Greek Dependency Treebanks, Aphthonius, Pedalion, Gorman, Sematia and PROIEL, can be combined to enhance the
progress in the automated parsing of classical and post-classical Greek texts.

3.6.2 Modern Greek

To facilitate the reader, below we first discuss the works related to POS tagging (which are numerous), and then the rest
works about syntax. An overview of the Greek POS works is given in Table[2]

- POS tagging

describe a rule-based POS tagger by employing dictionaries of non-inflected words, affixation morphology and
limited surface syntax rules.

describe a machine learning approach for POS disambiguation and unknown word guessing. Both problems are
cast as classification tasks carried out by decision trees.

In and in the PhD thesis the use of transformation based error-driven learning for resolving part-of-speech
ambiguity in the Greek language is investigated.

propose a unified POS tagging architecture that uses a feature-based multi-tiered approach to cover the requirements
of tagging highly inflective languages such as Greek.


NLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024

propose an approach based on rules written in Prolog language for the generation of a lexicon of Greek compound
medical terminology. A similar approach is followed in for the construction of a computational lexicon of Greek
verbs for the stock market domain.

In a Bayesian network probabilistic model is introduced for POS tagging in Greek texts.

[94] present a method for morphological disambiguation in the absence of any gold standard corpora using several
statistical models, such as the Brill algorithm [89]. The methods were tested both on Greek and Yiddish.

[95] describe a machine learning approach to POS tagging and named entity recognition for Greek, focusing on the
extraction of morphological features and classification of tokens into a small set of classes, i.e., location, organization,
person and facility for named entities.

describe a part-of-speech tagged dataset of social text in Greek that contains 31,697 tokens originated from 2,405
tweets. In addition, a supervised part-of-speech tagger based on naive Bayes algorithm and specialized for such datasets,
is presented.

- Grammar
present a computational Modern Greek grammar written in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) [98].

describe the construction of the Greek Dependency Treebank while [00] describe the work towards the har-

monization of the Greek Dependency Treebank [‘http://gdt .ilsp.gr and https: //universaldependencies. org
treebanks/el_gdt/index.htm1]| with the Universal Dependencies v2 standard, and the extension of the treebank with

enhanced dependencies.

describe the application of paraphrasing to steganography. For the paraphrasing step a set of shallow empirical
rules are applied followed by a filtering process through a supervised machine learning approach. The syntactic
transformations are shallow and require minimal linguistic resources (e.g., [I went] [to the excursion] [yesterday].— >
[I went] [yesterday] [to the excursion].)

102] describes an implementation of a Modern Greek grammar in Grammatical Framework as part of the Grammatical
Framework Resource Grammar Library [103].

present an approach to integrate verb MWEs (Verb Multiword Expressions) in an LFG grammar of Modern Greek
and IDION [105] [idion.ilsp.gr/datal that contains about 2,000 verb MWEs (VMWEs) of which about 850 are

fully documented as regards their syntactic flexibility, their semantics and the semantic relations with other VMWEs.

present a tool for analyzing morphologically and syntactically sentences, phrases, and words in order to correct
syntactic, grammatical, and stylistic errors. The proposed approach takes into account some of the particularities of
Modern Greek such as its highly inflectional nature, the “free word order” form and the lexical ambiguity.

3.6.3 Endangered dialects

107] evaluate POS tagging techniques on an actual endangered language, Griko. The combination of a semi-supervised
method with cross-lingual transfer seems to be the more appropriate for this task given the small size of the used corpus.

3.7 Word embeddings

A word embedding method generally tries to map words, phrases or documents, to vectors of real numbers so
that semantic, syntactic and world knowledge can be captured and reflected in similar vectors based on distri-
butional hypothesis (111. To grasp the idea, the word tyAcoxdmo of our running example, according to the
FastText algorithm trained on a Greek corpus, is represented by a vector of 300 float numbers of the form
(0.74044, —0.070209, ... , 0.23586, 0.48267).

[113] present word embeddings [http://nlp.polytechnique .fr/resources-greek] and other linguistic resources

trained on a 50 GB corpus. The corpus was created by crawling the Greek internet web.

114] present an ensemble method, named Continuous Bag-of-Skip-grams (CBOS), for producing word representations
for the Greek language.

115] describe a Greek version of WordSim353 test collection [116] for a basic evaluation of word similarities, and the
testing of seven word vector models.

Tables[5]and|6]in Section/4.3]list and provide more details about the available (monolingual) embeddings in Modern
and Ancient Greek respectively.

3.8 Semantics

The semantic processing usually considers a representation of sentence structure (syntactic tree), a representation of
the possible meaning(s) of each word, and aims at producing a representation of the meaning of the sentence. This
process includes steps like word sense disambiguation, semantic role tagging, named entity recognition and linking, and
other tasks. Semantic role labeling aims at mapping spans in sentences to a predicate-argument structure. The structure
describes eventualities and participants in the sentence and is often described as answering “Who did what to whom”
question. Named entity recognition aims at identifying named entities, e.g. “AptototéAyc” in the phrase of Figure [2]
Named entity linking (NEL), also referred as entity linking is the task of semantically annotating entities mentioned in
text with entities described in knowledge bases (KBs).

3.8.1 Ancient Greek

119] present an annotation scheme for semantic role annotation for the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank.

linguistic context(s).

122] aim at computationally modelling Ancient Greek diachronic semantics based on Bayesian learning.

provides an approach for automatic role labeling in Ancient Greek based on a random forest classifier [124]. A
small semantically annotated corpus of Ancient Greek was used, annotated with a large amount of linguistic features,
including form of the construction, morphology, part-of-speech, lemmas, animacy, syntax and distributional vectors of
Greek words. Overall, the distributional semantic vectors features proved more important in the model.

125] present a NER model for the recognition of place-names and ethnonyms trained on a small manually annotated
list. Their approach use Conditional Ranfom Fields and relies on the recurring elements in the context.

3.8.2. Modern Greek

classification is performed. For the NER task a finite state parser on the basis of a pattern grammar is employed.

129] describe a freely available named-entity recognizer |http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software.htm1| for Greek texts

that identifies temporal expressions, person, and organization names. An ensemble of support vector machines
and active learning was used for person and organization names while for the recognition of temporal expressions
semi-automatically produced patterns.

130] introduce a keyword extraction technique focusing on Greek URLs by combining a transliteration engine and a
tokenizer.

about persons, organizations, geopolitical entities, legislation references, geographical landmarks and public document
references.

| 132] introduce a dataset focused on named entity recognition and further describe the experimentation with various
state-of-the-art models that are trained on this dataset.

12


NLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024

133] describe a pipeline for entity linking for Greek news articles. The pipeline consists of a BERT-based named entity
recognition step, a candidate generation step from a multitude of wiki-based KBs (Wikidata, DBpedia, Wikipedia,
YAGO) and finally a disambiguation step based on context and no context dependent embeddings.

As regards semantic relationships, [134] propose a distantly supervised transformer-based [135] relation extraction
model for semantic relationships extraction in literary texts of the 19th century Greek Literature.

3.9 Pragmatics (Dialogue systems)

Pragmatic analysis attempts to put each sentence into its general situational context, taking into account the contexts
in which it is said. Pragmatics encompasses speech act theory, conversational implicature talk and other approaches.
Unlike semantics that examines meaning as coded in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of
meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge of the speaker and listener but also on the context of

the utterance [136] i

This process includes various (and challenging) tasks including: resolution of references (e.g., pronouns), resolution of
semantic ambiguities, inferring the missing objects and actions, drawing inferences based on world knowledge and
common scenarios and scripts, linking sentences, identifying speech acts, understanding discussions and dialogues. For
example, from the perspective of Speech Acts Theory, the phrase of Figure [2]would be classified as Assertive.

3.9.1 Ancient Greek

passport. Rasa was also used for this chatbot and the code is available at |https://github.com/PantelisAntoniadis
PassBot_project ].

3.10 Sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying opinions, emotions and attitudes expressed in a piece
of text towards a particular topic, product, etc. For example, a tool for sentiment analysis would characterize the phrase
of Figure[2]as neutral.

144] implement a sentiment classifier applying SVM on hotel reviews written in Modern Greek. The corpus of hotel
reviews was collected from the Greek version of TripAdvisor and consists of 1,800 reviews (900 positive and 900

the refugee crisis.

In by employing a dataset consisting of all the documents that the members of the terrorist organization
“Revolutionary Organization 17 November” (17N) have published, a rule-based categorization task is performed to
discriminate between three categories: “no hate speech”, “moderate hate speech”, and “apparent hate speech”. Different
text analyzing techniques such as critical discourse and content analysis were preformed to decide the most effective
parameters and their thresholds.

18] present a survey for sentiment analysis tools and resources in Greek, and makes publicly available a rich set of such

resources |https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/greek-sentiment-lexicon], ranging from a manually annotated lexicon,

period 2013-2016. A follow-up work re-examine verbal aggression as an indicator of xenophobic attitudes in
Greek Twitter three years later to trace possible changes.

155] present an approach to analyze Greek text and extract indicative information towards users’ opinions and attitudes.
A supervised approach has been adopted to analyze and classify comments and reviews into the appropriate polarity
category. Discretization techniques are also applied to improve the performance and the accuracy of classification
procedures.

156] describe the creation of a corpus of over 1,300 tweets and it analyzes these exchanges based on the analytical
tools of the Lexical Constructional Model [157] (a framework that integrates the pragmatics and discourse dimensions
of language use).

lexicons and classification methods was followed.

present the first Greek annotated dataset for offensive language identification: the Offensive Greek Tweet Dataset
(OGTD) [https: //sites. google .com/site/offensevalsharedtask/home|. OGTD is a manually annotated dataset
containing 4,779 posts from Twitter annotated as offensive and not offensive. The authors have also trained a number of
systems on this dataset and report that the best results have been obtained from a system using LSTMs and GRU with
attention.

In [159] two available BERT type models for Greek (GreekBERT and PaloBERT, see more details in Table [5p were
fine-tuned for the task of emotion detection in social media textual content written in the Greek language. The evaluation
showed that fine-tuned models outperform other approaches, especially those based on emotion lexicons.

3.11 Question Answering (QA)

Automatic QA systems are related to the long standing goal of retrieving precise answers to questions expressed in
natural language. Such systems have been introduced for the English language already in 60s like the BASEBALL
system [160].

knowledge bases.

| 163] evaluate five Machine Translation models, such as Bing and Helsinki, for translating contexts, questions and
answers for the task of QA. According to their experimental evaluation, the Bing model outperformed the others for the
Greek language, since it offered a more human readable translation. In addition, they propose an approach for QA for
the Greek language by combining Machine Translation and BERT QA approaches. Sentence similarity embeddings
were used for deciding whether a predicted answer was correct, partially correct or wrong.

3.12 Natural Language Generation (NLG)
Natural Language Generation refers to a process that takes as input data and text, and generates text in some human
language.

translation equivalent in the target text, by entering useful information about these items based on their context.

focus on the transliteration of Greeklish to Greek which could be considered as a preprocessing task of MT. They
adopt a supervised approach based on random forests (124). As a parenthetical note, Greeklish is Greek written using
the latin alphabet, a writing method that was popular in the early stages of adoption of web in Greece and as such it has
attracted also research interest [177|{178] [179] [180]. It is a fairly unrestricted language without following specific rules.
The work in depicts the usage of Greeklish today.

Greek poets of the 20th century, and applies multiple machine-learning algorithms to predict a writer’s likelihood of
committing suicide.

| 198] analyze the spontaneous speech of 58 stroke survivors in relation with their symptoms. From their transcribed
responses after prepossessing steps the tf and latent Dirichlet allocation [199] (LDA) processing techniques were
applied. Speech and arm were the concepts referred most in agreement with the related bibliography.

3.14.8 NLP and crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing is a sourcing model in which individuals or organizations obtain goods and services from a large,
relatively open and often rapidly evolving group of participants, typically through the internet.
200] present “Erasitechnis”, a game for collecting music annotations.

201] describe data collection tasks for parallel translation implemented using a crowdsourcing platform.

3.14.9 Metaphor detection

Metaphor detection refers to the identification of metaphors, where a metaphor is a figure of speech that describes
an object or action in a way that is not literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. Metaphors are

pervasive in natural language, and detecting them requires contextual reasoning about whether specific situations can
actually happen.

17


NLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024

202] focus on the automatic differentiation between literal and metaphorical meaning in authentic non-annotated

phrases from the Corpus of Greek Texts [203] by means of computational methods of

machine learning.

3.14.10 Irony detection

Irony detection refers to the identification of irony in texts, where a text utterance is perceived to be ironic if its intended
meaning is opposite to what it literally expresses.

204] describe a classification schema for irony detection in Greek political tweets relying on limited labelled training
data, thus a semi-supervised approach is followed, where collective learning algorithms take both labelled and unlabelled
data into consideration.

3.14.11 Genre identification

Genre Identification refers to the task of assigning a particular piece of a text to a literary category (e.g., poem, prose
etc).

205] describe a method that utilizes 22 stylometric features for the tasks of genre detection, author identification, and
author verification. Multiple regression and discriminant analysis have been applied over a Greek corpus containing
texts from web. This work among the features already used in previous works introduces analysis-level style markers
(e.g., chunks’ morphological descriptions/total detected chunks) that represent the way in which the input text has been
analyzed by a NLP tool.

206] present a method for automatic style categorisation of text corpora in the Greek language, where each text is
represented by a vector of both structural and morphological characteristics, and categorisation is achieved by comparing
this vector to given archetypes using a statistical-based method.

207] present an exploratory study for identifying the features that characterize the genre of different text types i.e.,
short stories, new articles, recipes and dictionary.

In [208] almost all classical Greek literature was identified as prose or verse with supervised learning based on a
stylometric feature set for Ancient Greek language.

209] employs LDA topic modelling to automatically retrieve passages in an Ancient Greek corpus by calculating three
scores, namely good and virtue, scientific enquiry and philosophicalness.

3.14.12 Fake news detection

Fake news detection refers to the process of spotting the deliberate presentation of (typically) false or misleading claims
that are typically presented as news. Note that the term fake news has been gradually been replaced by term information
disorder which is more inclusive [210].

211] in his thesis examines the methods and tools Greek users implement in order to spot fake news on social media
and counter its spread. The data were collected from the members of the Ellinika Hoaxes Facebook group.

212] propose a system for the automatic creation of fake news datasets that is based on the fake news stories (e.g.,
fabrication, propaganda and parody) provided by curated fact-checking websites. The proposed method was used for
the creation of a Greek dataset with fake news tweets. Unfortunately, the created dataset is not available.

3.14.13 Legal domain

The automatic processing of law text could support both practitioners and general public to have better access to justice,
rights and entitlements. However, the specialized characteristics of legal language requires a different treatment from
general text. We have identified four such works for the Greek language.

213] study standard stylometric features in a corpus of Greek legal texts. Further, statistical analysis is applied for the
comparison with a corpus of the general language. The formulaic language, the preference to nouns and impersonal
constructions, the use of technical vocabulary, and the length and complexity of sentences are among of the findings for
legal texts.

214] present a method based on regular expressions for the automated extraction of acronyms in legal Greek texts.

215] focus on Greek legislation documents and propose an approach for modeling and querying them based on
Semantic Web technologies, as well as for their integration with other Linked Oped Data.

NLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024

216] present an ongoing project for the automated analysis and processing of Greek legal documents towards their
transformation into Legal Open Data.

217] study the task of classifying Greek legal texts. A dataset based on Greek legislation is introduced and then several
machine learning approaches are tested ranging from traditional machine learning, RNN-based and Transformer-based
methods (both monolingual and multilingual). Monolingual transformer-based models achieved the best performance.

3.14.14 Authorship

Authorship identification (detection or attribution) refers to the process of determining the writer of a document based
on a collection of known documents. Author verification, plagiarism detection, author profiling or characterization and
the detection of stylistic inconsistencies are some other tasks of authorship analysis.

In [218] a method for discriminating among a close set of authors is presented. Each text is represented as a vector of
features covering several linguistic aspects and the discrimination analysis is based on statistical techniques.

explore topic influence in authorship attribution. They used a balanced corpus of two authors, whose newswire
articles are equally divided in two distinctive topics, culture and politics. Many commonly used stylometric variables
were calculated and for each one they performed a two-way ANOVA test [220]. The results reveal that many stylometric
variables are actually discriminating topic rather than authors.

221) present a machine learning approach to automatically identify Big Five personality traits 1.e., openness to
experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism from the linguistic analysis of author’s text. The
analysis was based on texts produced by 382 participants that each one wrote an essay and complete a questionnaire.

In a long lasting dispute about the authorship of Rhesus play, traditionally attributed to Euripides, is investigated.
Frequency of words and character-grams analysis lead the authors to conclude that the author of Rhesus was probably
an actor whose repertoire included Euripides and Aeschylus (but not Sophocles) who was a great admirer of Aeschylean
grandeur and style.

In another work for Ancient Greek morpho-syntactic data without regard to specific vocabulary items are examined
for the task of author identification in short texts by exploiting supervised machine learning approaches. For Modern
Greek, [224] employ a supervised learning approach for authorship attribution and use as features a mixture of n-grams
both in terms of size (bigrams and trigrams) and type (word and character n-grams). present a comparative
assessment of the difficulty of authorship attribution in Greek and in English. Based on a corpus introduced in this work
different methods of author attribution were applied and the results show that, overall, performance on English is higher
than performance on Greek.

[226] introduces a BERT model for Ancient Greek. It demonstrates that Modern Greek BERT after transfer
learning via Masked Learning Modelling (MLM) on several corpora of Ancient Greek texts could be further fine-tuned
for the authorship attribution task. The model is then used to assist an author and style attribution of a couple of recently
discovered texts.

3.14.15 Education - analytics

NLP techniques has been also applied to facilitate teaching and learning processes in Greek.

227] investigate some of the most widely known readability measures namely Flech-Kincaid [228], SMOG [229] and
FOG [230], for the Greek language and analyze the degree of their agreement.

231] present the tool “diaKeimenou" that assesses the suitability of a text corpus for use in Greek language teaching by
employing various NLP tools (e.g., POS tagger, dependency parser etc). The assessment is based on four criteria: (i)
text readability, (ii) content, (111) genre, and (iv) grammatical information.

describe the project “Lexipaignio” that intends to develop a NLP environment for the creation of digital educational
games for students of primary and secondary education in Greece. The games aim to cover a variety of school subjects
such as Geography and Biology apart from Linguistics.

233] address the task of classifying Greek texts according to their readability score. For this purpose, textbook Greek
corpora are trained by using a total of 215 features.

234] introduce the Greek version of the automatic grammatical error annotation tool ERRANT [235] along with two
evaluation datasets with errors from native Greek learners and Wikipedia Talk pages edits. Such a tool can have multiple
applications to computer aided learning (CAL), for example to help learners of Greek as a Second Language.

3.14.16 Controlled natural languages

Controlled natural languages (CNLs) are subsets of natural languages that are obtained by restricting the grammar and
vocabulary. The purpose of such languages is to reduce or eliminate ambiguity and complexity of natural language in
order to facilitate tasks such as translation and retrieval. CNLs can have human or machine orientation.

108] describe a large-scale Greek morphological lexicon (along its architecture, construction and evolution process),
that was used to develop a lemmatiser and a morphological analyser. These tools were integrated in a controlled
language checker for Greek.

236] describe a set of controlled language specifications defined for Modern Greek, and examine the effectiveness
and suitability of these specifications by assessing the performance of a commercial machine translation system over
controlled texts.

4 Resources and Evaluation Collections

This section is organized as follows: Section|4. I]lists a few portals containing various NLP resources for the Greek
language, Section [4.2]lists Greek dictionaries, lexicons and thesauri, Section|4.3] lists corpora and datasets suitable
for comparatively evaluating various NLP tasks (over Greek resources), and finally Section [4.4] presents some of the
available tools for processing Greek text.

Overall, we concentrated on documenting linguistic resources with permissive licences and whenever it was feasible
to provide the link to the downloadable resource. Besides of the open-source criterion, the selection of the resources
was based on other criteria too such as the community evaluation (when the resource is shared via repositories like
GitHut{'] e.g., Stars), whether the resource is related to a peer-reviewed published work and our subjective view about its
usefulness and easiness of integration in an application etc. Although, the availability of a resource was a determinant
factor for the inclusion of the resource in the following lists, we strongly advise the reader that want to reuse a resource
to carefully check the license and/or contact the creator(s) for further clarifications.

NLP FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE: A LONGER SURVEY - AUGUST 21, 2024

5 Concluding Remarks

To aid those who are interested in developing or advancing the techniques for processing Greek language, in this paper
we have presented a list of related works and resources, organized according to some general thematic categories. In
total we have found, categorized and described in brief, around 166 papers, 38 corpora, 18 datasets, 10 toolkits, 25 tools
and 19 web interfaces. We chose not to put emphasis to language agnostic approaches, without however question their
significance, but instead to focus on works that take into account language and cultural characteristics of the Greek
language, following in this respect a recent publication thread [326] [327].

We have observed a rapid progress the last 7 years in all manifestations of Greek language (Ancient, Modern, dialects)
that spreads out to versatile tasks of NLP, and an increase of open resources. Around 19% of the works are about
Ancient Greek. Most of the studies about Modern Greek originate from Greek universities and institutes, while most of
the works about Ancient Greek originate from organizations outside Greece. We have found a relatively high number
of papers on sentiment analysis, and a rekindle interest for dialogue systems. On the antipode, we have observed a
relatively low number of works in tasks like question answering, summarization and coreference resolution. Lastly, the
need of more datasets of a certain quality is a diachronic request for the progress of the area. The taxonomy in
that is based on a quantitative investigation on labelled and unlabelled datasets for 2,485 languages, places Greek in
the middle of the 6-scale classification in the “Rising Stars” category. Clearly, there is room for improvement, at least
for the creation of lablelled datasets. Certain requirements like distribution in interoperable and standard formats,
continuous maintenance, and application of ethical collection processes, must also be taken into account.

We believe our survey provides a timely guidance on the literature and resources about Greek NLP for researchers,
engineers and educators.
