Abstract

Making our research results positively impact
on society and environment is one of the goals
our community has been pursuing recently. Al-
though financial technology (FinTech) is one
of the popular application fields, we notice that
there is no discussion on how NLP can help
in FinTech for the social good. When men-
tioning FinTech for social good, people are
talking about financial inclusion and green fi-
nance. However, the role of NLP in these di-
rections only gets limited discussions. To fill
this gap, this paper shares our idea of how we
can use NLP in FinTech for social good. We
hope readers can rethink the relationship be-
tween finance and NLP based on our sharing,
and further join us in improving the financial
literacy of individual investors and improving
the supports for impact investment.

1 Introduction

Recently, our community is eager for the discus-
sions on AI for social good! and NLP for social
good.” Although we have several surveys and opin-
ion pieces from different aspects (Hovy and Spruit,
2016; Leins et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2021), there is
hardly any discussion on how NLP can help in Fin-
Tech for social good development. As the FinTech
industry matures, we think that it is time to discuss
the potential risk and what we can do to address
these issues with the help of NLP.

When mentioning FinTech for social good, there
are many discussions on how FinTech development
can improve financial inclusion (Ozili, 2021). Fi-
nancial inclusion is a notion to express that every-
one can get basic financial services and have an
opportunity to access financial products. With the
development of mobile banking and wireless inter-
net, more and more individuals in developing coun-
tries can access financial services such as cashless

calls-ai-for-good/

*https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/

payment, deposits, and insurance (Analytics, 2018).
With the development of online identity authenti-
cation, people in developed countries can easily
access financial products such as equity and op-
tions by opening an account within a few minutes.
Both are important achievements in the FinTech
industry.

However, we notice some attendant risks follow-
ing the improvement of financial inclusion. Based
on the statistics of the Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TWSE), people in their twenties occupy over 80%
of accounts opened. On the other hand, based on
the statistics of the Taiwan Academy of Banking
and Finance*, a government-supervised institution,
approximately 40% of people in their twenties are
financially illiterate. Even those who graduated
from a university, only 5% of them are consid-
ered to have a good sense to finance. Although
joining the financial market could make people
become wealthy, it may also lead to bankrupting
results. Given 80/20 Rule, i.e., 80% of individual
investors will only get profit and loss balance out-
come or deficit, which is supported in financial mar-
ket (Xiao, 2015), can we do something to protect
individual investors? One of the recent examples*
also indicates that making trading process becomes
easy and game-like may lead to negative outcomes
when the user does not have enough knowledge to
understand the risk of investment and the results
of these actions. Following this line of thought,
we want to discuss how we can improve financial
literacy with FinTech and NLP (FinNLP).

Taking the environment and society into consid-
eration when making daily decisions is one of the
tendencies for sustainable development. It is the
same in financial decision-making. Instead of only
considering return and risk, some people in the

financial domain advocate adding social and envi-
ronmental impact to the decision-making process.
To be the bridge between the financial field and
the FinNLP community, we also make discussions
on how FinNLP can support the development of
impact investment.

In the rest of this paper, we will first discuss cur-
rent FinNLP research and the role of these studies
in FinTech development in Section 2. In Section 3,
we propose two directions, investor education and
impact investment, for FinNLP for social good.
Some challenges and possible solutions will be pro-
vided in Section 4. Finally, we conclude this paper
in Section 5. Our intention is to propose some dif-
ferent directions, which got few discussions before,
to inspire researchers to figure out some ways for
FinNLP for social good together.

2 Current FinNLP Research

FinTech is an emerging term from 2015, and the
development of FinNLP has three major directions:
improving the working processes in financial insti-
tutions, predicting market information, and provid-
ing automatic financial services to customers (Chen
et al., 2020). Improving the working processes can
enlarge the capability of financial institutions to
serve more people, and providing automatic finan-
cial services can improve the customers’ experi-
ence. Both are the key forces in achieving financial
inclusion.

From the aspect of improving working processes,
one of the widely discussed topics is identity fraud
detection because it is a crucial issue when peo-
ple use services remotely. One ideal solution is
to ask some new questions that could not be an-
swered based on user-provided data. Wang et al.
(2019) share the experimental results of this idea,
and generate questions based on extended personal
knowledge graphs to improve performance.

Forecasting market information is the most popu-
lar direction in FinNLP development. Stock move-
ment (Xu and Cohen, 2018; Tang et al., 2021),
volatility (Rekabsaz et al., 2017; Dereli and Sar-
aclar, 2019; Qin and Yang, 2019; Chen et al.,
2021b), sales (Lin et al., 2019), bubble (Sawhney
et al., 2022), and several different kinds of mar-
ket information are targets of market information
forecasting tasks. In addition to constructing end-
to-end models for prediction, there are some other
discussions on how to fool NLP-based market pre-
diction models (Xie et al., 2022) and the problems

of pre-trained language models in market informa-
tion forecasting applications (Chuang and Yang,
2022).

Instead of giving predictions directly, leveraging
NLP techniques to provide customers information
for them to make the final decision is a human-
centered approach. Some systems are proposed for
this purpose. Liou et al. (2021) propose a system
to help investors and journalists identify the related
companies based on a given news article. Hassan-
zadeh et al. (2022) present a comprehensive system
for news retrieval, event identification, causal anal-
ysis, and causal knowledge graph extraction. Users
can make decisions based on the outputs of these
systems.

3 FinNLP for Social Good

Thanks to the effort of researchers in the FinNLP
community, models can better understand finan-
cial documents than before, and some application
scenarios can be implemented for the customers
of financial institutions. However, how to make
social good based on our findings has been hardly
discussed so far. In this section, we propose two di-
rections: investor education and impact investment.
Investor education is a way to improve financial
literacy, which is one of the world-level projects
proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD)°. Impact in-
vestment is a concept that adds one more dimension
—impact on the environment and society— into con-
sideration when making investment decisions. The
goal of these two directions is to construct a sus-
tainable financial environment. In this section, we
provide the link between these topics and FinNLP.

3.1 Investor Education

Currently, investor education is provided passively.
For example, the United States Securities and Ex-
change Commission (SEC) provides many teach-
ing materials for investors,° and TWSE also makes
many efforts to prepare materials for investor edu-
cation’. We think that NLP provides an opportunity
to change from passive to active. Instead of asking
investors to take a look at the materials, we can
score their investment ideas and provide feedback

financial-—education/

Shttps://www.sec.gov/education/
investor-education

Thttps://investoredu.twse.com.tw/
Pages/TWSE.aspx



on their ideas. Thus, for investor education, we pro-
pose two directions: scoring investment reasons,
and generating risk reminders.

Scoring opinions is not a new topic in our
community. For example, scoring persuasive es-
says (Ghosh et al., 2016) and evaluating the help-
fulness of product reviews (Ocampo Diaz and Ng,
2018) have been discussed for a long time. How-
ever, scoring investment opinions is still in the early
stage. Ying and Duboue (2019) provide a pilot
exploration on scoring investment reasons by an-
notating 2,622 rationales into four levels. Chen
et al. (2021a) evaluate amateurs’ opinions based
on whether they share some characteristics with
experts’ opinions. These studies also point out two
different goals of scoring investment opinions: (1)
scoring rationality and (2) using profitability as the
score.

Since there are too many uncertainty factors in
the financial market, it is hard to say whether the
reasonable analysis will lead to profitable outcomes.
Even professionals’ analysis may sometimes be
inaccurate (Zong et al., 2020). Therefore, the goal
of scoring investment reasons is different from that
of making predictions. We aim to inform investors
whether their reasons can support their decision
based on financial theories. Additionally, we can
let investors know to what extent it will lead to
a profitable outcome based on the learned results
with historical data.

However, only providing the score is not enough
for investors to learn from models’ output. Provid-
ing feedback is more useful than just letting users
know the score. For example, grammatical error
correction (Xie et al., 2018) is one of the common
next steps after scoring essays. Providing feedback
to the grammatical error (Nagata, 2019) is a more
challenging task. In investor education, we think
that providing risk reminders to the given invest-
ment reasons is more important than just providing
scores. For example, when users input their reasons
as the follows: ®

Key takeaways from Quanta’s 1Q22 ana-
lyst call included: 1) 1Q22 GMs dipped
to an eight-quarter low due to inferior
product mix and inefficient production;
2) weak 2Q22 earnings outlook with
both PC demand weakness and supply

constraints; 3) 2Q22 NB shipment guid-
ance at 20% qoq declines missed mar-
ket expectations, implying likely m/s
loss towards Hon Hai, in our view; 4)
Server order book remains intact with
double-digit growth target this year; 5)
full-year capex at NT$10bn with over-
seas expansion (Thailand, North Amer-
ica); and 6) the board approved a NT$6.6
DPS, implying 8% yields at current stock
prices. Quanta stock has moved largely
in line with Taiex YTD, while we expect
the earnings downgrade (first time since
2019) to weigh on the stock price in the
next six months. We cut 2022/23 earn-
ings by 15%/7% and lower our Dec-22
PT to NT$77. Stay Neutral.

In addition to providing scores, we think that it
will be more meaningful if models can generate the
risk reminders to this neutral opinion as follows:

Key downside risks include margin ero-
sion in servers and a potential slowdown
of PC demand post COVID-19.

Key upside risks include 1) a longer-
than-expected server upcycle; and 2)
stronger- than-expected MacBook mar-
ket share gains offset consumer PC weak-
ness.

This kind of risk reminder is different from the
outputs of end-to-end market movement prediction
models. It provides some scenarios that may make
the neutral claim become inaccurate. We think that
it is an ideal way to provide feedback on financial
opinions. In this way, investors can take the gener-
ated risk into consideration when making decisions.
It will also help investors consider their investment
reasons more comprehensively.

3.2 Impact Investment

Beyond considering return and risk in the invest-
ment, the impact on the environment and society
has been widely discussed and suggested to add to
the financial decision-making process (Emerson,
2012; Chiappini, 2017). More and more concrete
ideas for assessment and auditing are proposed.
Recently, one of the most popular guidelines is
SASB Standards, proposed by Sustainability Ac-
counting Standards Board.? This standard sorts

https: //www.sasb.org/


out the non-monetary issues related to environmen-
tal, social, and governance (ESG) that may influ-
ence the financial performance of companies. It
is intuitive that NLP can help in capturing ESG-
related terms (Kang et al., 2021) or tracking se-
mantic change in companies’ reports (Purver et al.,
2022). However, can FinNLP help more on impact
investment? We propose two directions for this
question: non-monetary opportunity/risk identifica-
tion and scenario planning.

As we shown in Section 2, many studies pay
attention to monetary return or volatility prediction.
It can be based on news articles, social media, pro-
fessional reports, meeting between investors and
company managers, and so on. However, limited
studies try to identify the opportunity and risk from
non-monetary aspects, i.e., ESG aspect. Since the
impact period of ESG-related events may be longer
than that of traditional monetary events, such as
the increase of earning, decrease of sales, etc, we
think that one of the important directions is to iden-
tify whether the given event is the opportunity or
risk to ESG and how it will influence companies’
sustainable operation. As shown in Li et al. (2022),
simple statistical methods perform better than neu-
ral network models in multivariate long sequence
time-series forecasting. That raises an open is-
sue: whether their claim holds true when we at-
tempt to evaluate long-term non-monetary impacts?
Since many market information forecasting studies
mainly pay attention to short-term prediction (e.g.,
next day, 3-day, and 1 week), we want to encourage
more studies to pay attention to long-term value
assessment.

In addition to identifying the opportunity and
risk, we think that scenario planning (analysis) is
one of the key directions that FinNLP can help in
impact investment. The goal of scenario planning
is to understand the possible impact of the event
better rather than to predict the future. For example,
in addition to identifying whether it is a risk to the
agricultural industry when a piece of news related
to “climate anomalies” is given, we expect models
to generate some plausible scenarios such as “it
would lead to lack of water’, and this scenario can
be extended to “it may influence the agricultural
industry”.

Besides the most possible scenario, the worst-
case scenario should also be generated for discus-
sion. That is, when performing scenario planning,
experts first generate many scenarios regardless of

the probability of occurrence. And then, experts
will select a few key scenarios for discussions and
try to figure out some solutions to these key scenar-
ios. Because scenario planning plays an important
role in both monetary and non-monetary based fi-
nancial decision, we think that it is a good direction
to explore for providing better help to both individ-
ual and industrial investors.

4 Challenges and Opportunities

Because we just start in the proposed directions,
there are many open research questions and oppor-
tunities. In this section, we highlight three specific
topics.

4.1 Evaluation

One of the conveniences of market information
forecasting tasks is that we can use market infor-
mation as ground truth. It is open access and can
be quickly obtained. However, when exploring the
proposed risk reminder and scenario planning tasks,
we should not just focus on the final outcome in
the market. For example, the key downside/upside
risks shown in Section 3.1 may not happen finally,
but these reminders are important for leading in-
vestors to have careful consideration before mak-
ing decisions. In other words, previous studies are
precision-focused studies, but the proposed direc-
tions aim to highlight the importance of covering
as more as crucial factors as possible. Human eval-
uation is an intuitive direction. However, how to
automatically evaluate the generated scenarios is
still an open issue.

4.2 Implementation

It is hard to imagine that an analyst says, “I have
read a lot of news from 2008 to 2010, analysis
reports from 2003 to 2012, cooperate filing from
1994 to 2019, and earnings call transcripts from
2004 to 2019. Based on these experiences and
yesterday’s Made by Google product launch, I
think Pixel Watch would be the hottest product
in 2022.” However, we are now using pretrained
FinBERTs (Araci, 2019; Huang et al., 2022) in
this way. There is no doubt that some common
senses and word meanings can be learned via pre-
trained processes. However, the financial market
changes all the time, and there is a bulk of infor-
mation daily. How to add the latest knowledge
and news into models becomes a challenge when
we want to score investment reasons and generate


risk reminders. One of the possible ways is using
the knowledge in textual book and formal material
to construct knowledge graph (KG) as the base of
background knowledge. And then, we can further
link this KG with the temporal-aware KG (Goel
et al., 2020), which tracks the change of latest in-
formation.

4.3 Utilization

Currently, the FinTech industry provides more con-
venient interfaces to investors, and also makes fi-
nancial information become transparent. Many
trading bots have been constructed to displace indi-
vidual investors when making trading decisions. In
this paper, we propose a human-centered AI con-
cept with FinNLP, which aims to empower human
abilities instead of replacing human. We think that
the proposed directions for investor education are
the next step for improving the investment envi-
ronment of individual investors. There are many
open research questions when exploring the pro-
posed directions. To what extent state-of-the-art
market information prediction models can help in
scoring investment reasons? What is the difference
between general storytelling tasks and financial
scenario generation? We also think that investor ed-
ucation and current FinNLP studies are reciprocal.
For example, scoring rationales can help us filter
out low-quality opinions for opinion-based market
information prediction models. It would be helpful
in improving the performance of existing tasks.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we point out the risk behind the recent
improvement in financial inclusion, and share a re-
search agenda from FinNLP for social good aspect.
We hope this paper can lead readers to rethink the
role of NLP in the financial field. Different from re-
cent FinNLP studies, which focus on (1) extracting
cooperation reports, analyst reports, news articles,
and so on, and (2) using the extracted information
for constructing economics/financial indicators or
end-to-end market information prediction models,
we propose two directions that could help improve
financial literacy and augment investors’ ability in
making impact-oriented financial decisions. We are
not saying the proposed directions are completely
new, but we want to guide our community to con-
sider to what extent recent findings can be applied
to these directions and what we can do to achieve
these goals. Our intent is that this paper can set

an example for others to follow, and future works
can further propose more ideas and solutions for
FinNLP for social good.
