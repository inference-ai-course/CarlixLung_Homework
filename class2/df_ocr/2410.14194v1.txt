Abstract

Natural Language Processing (NLP) research on AI Safety and social bias in
AI has focused on safety for humans and social bias against human minorities.
However, some AI ethicists have argued that the moral significance of nonhuman
animals has been ignored in AI research. Therefore, the purpose of this study is
to investigate whether there is speciesism, i.e., discrimination against nonhuman
animals, in NLP research. First, we explain why nonhuman animals are relevant
in NLP research. Next, we survey the findings of existing research on speciesism
in NLP researchers, data, and models and further investigate this problem in this
study. The findings of this study suggest that speciesism exists within researchers,
data, and models, respectively. Specifically, our survey and experiments show
that (a) among NLP researchers, even those who study social bias in AI, do not
recognize speciesism or speciesist bias; (b) among NLP data, speciesist bias is
inherent in the data annotated in the datasets used to evaluate NLP models; (c)
OpenAI GPTs, recent NLP models, exhibit speciesist bias by default. Finally, we
discuss how we can reduce speciesism in NLP research.*

1 Introduction

Research on social bias in AI has surged in the natural language processing (NLP)
since the advent of pretraining models such as Word2Vec [1] and BERT [2]. These
models were primarily used in NLP research, and some researchers discovered their
inherent social biases [3]. Initially, social bias research in NLP models focused on
binary gender and race [4, 5]. However, the limited number of social attributes studied
is problematic. Therefore, some bias researchers have worked on a variety of attributes
such as disability [6], sexual orientation [7], and intersectional ones [8, 9], as well as
studying negative bias toward queer people living in non-binary genders [10]. Moreover,
other studies have found that large language models (LLMs) generate harmful and
stereotypical representations [11] and have proposed AI alignment methods to prevent
them [12]. Thus, NLP researchers are seriously combating discriminative biases and
harmful behaviors of NLP models.

On the other hand, one attribute that is ignored in NLP research is nonhuman
animals. Our aim is to seek an answer to the following research questions: a) what is the
extent to which discrimination against nonhuman animals, referred to as speciesism,
is overlooked in NLP research? and b) how can we investigate speciesist bias present
in NLP data and models? As some existing studies have suggested, speciesist bias
against nonhuman animals has rarely been studied in NLP research (see Section 3.3.1).
AI ethicists have criticized moral anthropocentrism in response to these problems,
observing that nonhuman animals are ignored in AI ethics (see Section 3.1).

This study investigates speciesism or speciesist bias among NLP researchers
(Section 3), NLP data (Section 4), and NLP models (Section 5) in order to identify
speciesism in NLP research. We also explain why it is crucial to recognize speciesism
in NLP research (Section 2) and, finally, discuss what we should do to challenge
speciesism in NLP research (Section 6).

2 Motivation

2.1 What Is Speciesism and Why Do Nonhuman Animals
Morally Matter

Speciesism is “the unjustified comparatively worse consideration or treatment of those
who do not belong to a certain species” [13]. Typical examples of speciesist practices
are factory farming and animal experimentation [14]. Nonhuman animals such as cows,
pigs, and chickens are bred for human consumption in cramped and poor conditions.
There is a consensus among scientists that these nonhuman animals are conscious
and sentient [15]. Therefore, they experience pain during captivity and slaughter.
Similarly, in animal experimentation, although there are regulations such as the 3Rs
(Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) [16], more than seven million nonhuman
animals were used, and most of them were killed in the EU in 2020 [17].

If we think that the suffering of nonhuman animals holds less moral significance
than that of humans solely because they are nonhuman animals, that is speciesism.
Drawing an analogy with racism and sexism [14], if one considers the interests of a
human being of a particular race or gender to be less morally significant than the


interests of people of another race or gender, then one would consider that to be
racism or sexism. Similarly, if one considers the interests of members of a particular
species (nonhumans) less morally significant than the interests of human beings by
their belonging to that species, that is speciesism.

There are many discussions in animal ethics on such speciesism [18], and, at least,
it is difficult to defend a kind of speciesism where the interests of one being are less
morally significant than the interests of another being by just belonging to a particular
species [e.g., 19]. This paper assumes that similar interests (e.g., pain or preference to
avoid it) should be treated equally and that any form of speciesism that denies this
assumption is incorrect [cf. 20]. However, even if this assumption is false, the content
of this study should be relevant for people who accept that sentient nonhuman animals
are of some moral significance.

2.2 Why Do Nonhuman Animals Matter in NLP Research

There are four reasons to take nonhuman animals seriously in NLP research if we
accept that they are morally significant [cf. 20-22].

First, if NLP models such as LLMs have a speciesist bias, then they propagate the
speciesist bias. As described in many social bias studies of AI, the bias inherent in
NLP technology is propagated to people through applications such as machine trans-
lation and dialogue systems [cf. 23-25]. It reinforces the discriminatory bias in their
attitudes. Some psychological studies have shown that people already have speciesist
attitudes [26, 27]. These attitudes could be reinforced by the speciesist output gener-
ated by NLP technology. It may also further reinforce the speciesist practices discussed
above (Section 2.1), such as factory farming and animal experimentation.

Second, psychological experiments also suggest that these and other speciesist atti-
tudes are correlated with other discriminatory attitudes. People with speciesism tend
to have racist and sexist attitudes [26], which are associated with social dominance ori-
entation! and political conservatism [28, 29]. Therefore, reinforcing speciesist attitudes
may reinforce other discriminatory attitudes. If NLP models propagate discriminatory
biases, then removing the speciesist bias in NLP models would be beneficial not only
for nonhuman animals but also for humans.

Third, NLP technologies with a speciesist bias could harm those who are opposed
to speciesist practices, such as ethical vegans. Consider, for example, LLMs associating
negative words with nonhuman animals or recommending dishes that utilize nonhuman
animal products to vegans. They would be harmed by such behavior of LLMs and
would stop using this technology. This harm is a form of technological exclusion [cf.
30] and discrimination against them [31].

Finally, NLP models and corpora inherently reflect social biases, including
speciesist bias, present in our cognition, beliefs, and social structures [5, 32-34]. Ana-
lyzing social biases in NLP models and corpora can promote our understanding of its
influence on our cognition and society.

groups” [28]


2.3 Why Do We Focus on Speciesism in NLP Researchers,
Data, and Models

We argued that nonhuman animals are morally significant and matter in NLP research.
However, as this study shows in the following sections (see Sections 3-5), speciesism
is rarely considered in NLP research. This paper aims to reveal speciesism in NLP
research by focusing on researchers, data, and NLP models. We explain why we
consider these three entities.

First, if there is a speciesism bias in NLP models, then there is a risk of reinforcing
people’s speciesist attitudes through generated text. Furthermore, it would lead to the
technical exclusion of ethical vegans and anti-speciesist people. Therefore, it is crucial
to analyze the speciesism bias in NLP models.

Second, it is also relevant to identify speciesist bias in the NLP data. It will con-
tribute to identifying the origin of the speciesist bias in the NLP model. Furthermore,
if speciesist bias is found in the data, reducing this bias in the data will contribute to
mitigating speciesist bias in future developed NLP models.

Finally, it is also essential to identify speciesism among NLP researchers them-
selves. Primarily, NLP researchers design and create NLP data, especially data for
downstream tasks and NLP models. Thus, if there is speciesist bias in these NLP data
and models, it has its origin in the NLP researchers, at least partially. Furthermore,
benchmark datasets for evaluating NLP models are also developed primarily by NLP
researchers. If a benchmark dataset contains a speciesist bias, evaluating NLP models
would be inappropriate from an anti-speciesist view.? Therefore, NLP researchers play
an essential role in considering social bias [cf. 37]. If NLP researchers have speciesist
attitudes, removing these attitudes will lead to mitigating speciesist bias in NLP data
and NLP models through their research.

Therefore, this paper aims to identify speciesism in NLP researchers, data, and
models.

3 Speciesism among NLP researchers

We first explore speciesism among NLP researchers. Section 3.1 introduces the findings
of existing studies, Section 3.2 describes our additional research methodology, and
Section 3.3 reports our findings. Section 3.4 discusses the speciesism among NLP
researchers based on the findings of existing studies and our investigation.

We discuss speciesism in the NLP data (Section 4) and NLP model (Section 5)
similarly.

3.1 Existing Findings

Existing studies have not directly examined whether NLP researchers ignore the issue
of speciesism. However, by surveying AI ethics courses offered by companies and other

?One might think that speciesist bias is irrelevant to the benchmark design since the benchmark evaluates
only the linguistic ability of the NLP model. However, SuperGLUE [35], for example, includes Winogender
Schema Diagnostics [36], which assesses gender bias in NLP models. Thus, some benchmarks evaluate the
linguistic competence of an NLP model and whether it is ethically appropriate.


organizations and AI ethics guidelines, they have found that people engaged in AI
ethics (of which some NLP researchers may be a part) ignore speciesism.

Singer and Tse [20] argue that speciesism is not considered in AI ethics. They con-
ducted a search for AI ethics courses that provide detailed materials and discovered
a total of 71 such offerings. Of these, only one course touched on wildlife conserva-
tion, and the others did not address the impact of AI on nonhuman animals. The
authors also analyzed 68 statements on AI ethics issued by research institutions, non-
governmental organizations, governments, and corporations. Most of these statements
appealed to principles such as “benefits to humanity”. One-fifth of the statements
either assume that humans occupy a central position or imply that only humans are
of ethical importance. Only two statements appealed to “sentient beings”. Singer and
Tse argue that these statements incorrectly suggest that the significant harm that AI
inflicts on nonhuman animals is justified for the benefit of humans. Moreover, Owe
and Baum et al. [38] also surveyed existing guidelines or projects and concluded that
only a few guidelines or projects mention the interests of nonhuman animals.

3.2 Our Method of Investigating Speciesism of NLP
Researchers

This section investigates speciesism in NLP researchers by analyzing their papers. We
perform this investigation in two approaches. First, we investigate speciesism among
NLP researchers qualitatively. We analyze their efforts to address speciesist bias in AI
and their descriptions regarding social bias and nonhuman animals in their papers. We
also check whether there are any bias evaluation datasets including the speciesist bias
category. We refer the survey site of “Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A
Survey” [39].3

Second, we conduct a quantitative approach. We investigate (1) how NLP
researchers mention (if they do at all) “speciesism” or “anthropocentrism”*, and (2)
how NLP researchers use nonhuman animal names in the titles of their papers. In
the first quantitative investigation, we search for the words “speciesism” and “anthro-
pocentrism”® on the ACL Anthology® to analyze how many papers mention them
and how the words were used.’ In the second one, we hypothesize that some NLP
researchers use speciesist idioms and proverbs in their papers’ titles. We use ACL
Anthology Corpus [40], the most exhaustive NLP paper corpus, to count speciesist
titles. This corpus includes papers published in ACL Anthology until September 2022.
Animal names used to investigate speciesism in our research are shown in Table 1,
based on Takeshita et al. [21]. Some words in their list have two meanings, hence we
exclude these considered unlikely to mean nonhuman animal names.® Annotation of

The search for the adjective “speciesist” yielded four hits, all included in all five hits found by search-

ing for the noun “speciesism”. Also, the search for “anthropocentric” yielded the same results as for
“anthropocentrism”. Therefore, we will discuss the search results for the nouns only.

3.3 Our Findings of NLP Papers Analysis
3.3.1 Findings in Qualitative Investigation

Most of social bias studies in NLP ignore speciesist bias. Although numerous experi-
mental studies deal with social biases against humans, to the authors’ best knowledge,
there are only two studies regarding speciesist bias: Takeshita et al. [21] and Hagendorff
et al. [22].

Some surveys or papers that propose frameworks for social bias in Al also ignore
the speciesist bias or topics regarding nonhuman animals. For example, Gallegos et
al. [39] defined social groups as “a subset of the population that shares an identity trait,
which may be fixed, contextual, or socially constructed”. However, they also explained
that the examples of social groups are legally protected by anti-discrimination law (i.e.,
“nrotected groups” or “protected classes” under federal United States law) including
age, color, disability, gender identity, national origin, race, religion, sex, and sexual
orientation [39, p. 5]. They may not consider nonhuman animals in this definition.
Furthermore, Mei et al. [41] use “a comprehensive list of 93 social stigmas” pro-
posed by Pachankis et al. [42] to evaluate the social bias in NLP models. Smith et
al. [43] proposed the classification framework for social bias in AI, which calls itself the
“HOLISTICBIAS dataset”. However, there is no statement about nonhuman animals
in any of these studies.

Blodgett et al. [44] analyzed the pitfalls of bias evaluation datasets such as CrowS-
Pairs [7] and StereoSet [45]. For example, they pointed out the problem of an instance
of StereoSet represented in Table 2. Indeed, we agree with the pitfalls they describe.
However, they do not recognize the speciesist practice included in the sentence, “I
really like Norwegian salmon”, meaning the person likes to eat Norwegian salmon.
Furthermore, they represent salmon as an object. This expression is an example of
speciesist language. Another problematic instance they found in CrowS-Pairs dataset
is “Johnny had a feeling that the Scottish / American horse he bet on would win”. They
correctly claim that this sentence pair “is about horses from two countries, despite
the lack of an oppressive or harmful power dynamic there (as far as we know)” [44, p.
1007]. However, the practice of the horse race is a speciesist practice regarding horses.


Table 2 Problematic example from the StereoSet dataset given by Blodgett et al. [44]. They
provide “Pitfalls” but do not mention that the example also conveys speciesist point of view.

Pitfalls Description

Construct does not target a historically disadvantaged group unclear expectations

about the correct model behavior
Operationalization misspells the target group (Norweigan)

the context mentions an object (salmon), not a target group candidate
sentences not related to the context

The next speciesist example can be found in the work of Bender et al. [23]. Their
paper’s title, “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots,” uses speciesist language against
parrots. Moreover, they do not clarify what they mean by “Stochastic Parrots.” It
may mean that LLMs are merely stochastically parroting. However, parrots are not
simply parroting in response to input. Parrots are social beings with consciousness
and intent to communicate [46], while LLMs are not [cf. 47].

Finaly, we check existing bias evaluation datasets whether there are examples
including speciesist bias category, but we found none. The datasets, e.g., BOLD [48],
BBQ [9], CrowS-Pairs [7], and HolisticBias [43], which cover various social attributions,
do not include animal species or nonhuman animals.

3.3.2 Findings in Quantitative Investigation

We obtained five results for the search term “speciesism” and eleven results for the
search term “anthropocentrism” in the ACL Anthology. These results are less fre-
quent than the number of hits for “sexism” (1,690) and “racism” (2,380). On the
one hand, in the case of “speciesism”, one publication cited the study by Takeshita
et al. [21] and one by Hagendorff et al. [22]. Neither of these two found papers was
about speciesism or speciesist bias, but Hessenthaler et al. [49], who cited Takeshita et
al., mentioned speciesist bias as related research. None of the remaining publications
refers to speciesism or speciesist bias. In contrast, for “anthropocentrism,” there are
seven papers discussing the anthropocentric aspect of human language. Two papers
focus on anthropomorphism or animacy perception. Additionally, there is one con-
ference proceedings that encompasses two papers on the anthropocentric aspect of
human language. One publication specifically addressing computational linguistics.
All of them are not related moral anthropocentrism, which means that humans are
morally superior to or more significant than nonhuman animals.

Out of a total of 73,285 titles of NLP papers, we identified 154 titles that included
animal names. More than half are names of tools or datasets. However, 22 titles are


harmful expressions to nonhuman animals, for example: “Lipstick on a Pig...”, “Two
Birds, One Stone...”, “Killing Four Birds with Two Stones...”, and “Hunting for
the Black Swan...”.

3.4 Discussion on Speciesism among NLP Researchers

The investigation in this section suggests that NLP researchers do not recognize
speciesism. The qualitative investigation indicates that even researchers studying
social bias in AI are unaware of speciesism. Some researchers aim to compile a
“comprehensive list” of social biases by drawing from existing research, including
psychological studies. However, the common problem is that the existing research is
already anthropocentric, thus such lists are also anthropocentric.

Our quantitative survey indicates that NLP researchers have not conducted stud-
ies on speciesism and moral anthropocentrism. Furthermore, there are some uses of
speciesist idioms in the titles of some papers. These findings further support the obser-
vations made by AI ethicists, as Singer and Tse [20], and Owe and Baum [38] who
argued that most AI researchers seem to ignore speciesism.

The following section explores speciesism in data and models. As discussed in the
Section 2.3, these NLP data and models were created mainly by NLP researchers.
Based on the existing research and our own observations in this section, it is anticipated
that we will encounter instances of speciesism or speciesist bias in the data and models
we analyze below.

4 Speciesism in NLP data

4.1 Existing Research

Takeshita et al. [21] analyzed the Wikipedia dataset by counting how many animal
names are indicated by “who” or “which” as a relative pronunciation (Figure 1).
They found that except for “human” and a few nonhuman animal names, the use of
speciesist language (using “which” or “that” as relative pronounce) is more frequent
than the use of nonspeciesist language (using “who”, “whose” or “whom” ) in the cases
of nonhuman animal names. Furthermore, nonspeciesist language is relatively frequent
in some cases of nonhuman animal names such as “dog” and “cat”.

While searching for bias evaluation datasets in a investigation of speciesism among
NLP researchers (Section 3.2), we found that Nozza et al. [50] used HurtLex [51] to
evaluate how do BERT and GPT-2 generate hurtful stereotypes. HurtLex includes
“ANIMAL?” category as “Hate words and slurs beyond stereotypes”. We will discuss
this in Section 4.4.

4.2 Our Analysis Methodology in NLP Data

We investigate the data of the following downstream tasks: WNLI [52], Social Chem-
istry 101 [53], and Commonsense Morality in ETHICS [54]. WNLI is the task of
Winograd Schema Challenge [55] converted into natural language inference (NLI) for-
mat and included in the GLUE benchmark [52]. We hypothesize that there are cases of
speciesist language, such as using “it” or “which” to refer to nonhuman animal names.

Social Chemistry 101 [53] include the rule-of-thumb (RoT) which is defined as a
“descriptive cultural norm structured as the judgment of an action” [53, p. 654] in
English-speaking cultures, e.g., “It’s rude to run the blender at 5am.” This dataset
is used as a basis of other datasets for reflecting commonsense morality [e.g., 56, 57]
and for AI safety |e.g., 58]. If Social Chemistry 101 contains any speciesist RoTs, the
biased perspective is likely to spread to the derived datasets that rely on it, influencing
their content.

ETHICS [54] datasets consist of commonsense morality and the sub-category
dataset based on normative theories: utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, and jus-
tice. We analyze only the commonsense morality dataset. This is because only this
dataset is annotated to determine whether the actions represented in the data are

sisting of two sentences and one label. By comparing the two sentences, the label
indicates whether the agent in either sentence is more pleasant than the agent in the
other sentence but does not indicate which is morally right.

Annotation is performed by one of the authors of this paper, who studies animal
ethics. We use animal and meat names, as shown in Table 1. For meat names, we newly
collect names for detecting speciesist data in above datasets in the following steps: (1)
collecting meat names from USDA ERS’s Livestock and Meat Domestic Data’, (2)
using Word2Vec (google-news 300B)!° to collect the meat-describing words contained
in ten most similar words to each meat name collected in step (1).

4.3 Our Findings

We summarize our findings from this investigation in Table 3. For WNLI, we found
18 cases using speciesist language, an example is in Table 3.

In Social Chemistry 101, there are 2,332 cases including animal or meat names. It
is difficult to list all of them, hence we present only some speciesist examples: “It’s
okay to be excited when you catch a large fish.”; “You should eat your meat however
you best like it prepared.” These examples show that people think speciesist actions,
such as eating meat and catching a fish, are not morally wrong.

For Commonsense morality in ETHICS dataset, we found 864 cases including ani-
mal or meat names, of which 163 cases are speciesist. For example, the sentence
“T ate broccoli, chicken liver, fava beans, with a nice chianti” is labeled “0” which
means morally permissible action. However, this is not morally permissible from the
anti-speciesism or animal-friendly perspectives.

4.4 Discussion on Speciesism in NLP Data

Existing research indicates that the pretraining datasets include speciesist language.
Our additional investigation in this section reveals the use of speciesist language, along
with examples that support speciesist practices in the downstream task datasets.

There are at least two reasons why the downstream datasets contain speciesist
entries. First, it is because most annotators consider speciesism not to be morally
wrong. As Singer and Tse [20] argued, commonsense morality is favorable to
speciesism, so it is obvious that if researchers were to collect annotators without restric-
tions and have them annotate the data, they would create a dataset that is in favor
of speciesism.

Second, NLP researchers who develop guidelines for creating such datasets also
think that speciesism is not wrong. As indicated in the previous section, even
researchers studying the social bias in AI and AI safety fields are unaware of speciesism.
Therefore, they do not consider speciesism in creating their datasets, and they create
and publish datasets that include speciesist bias. Of course, part of the purpose of their
research is to reflect commonsense morality, so the inclusion of speciesist bias meets
that purpose. However, their other goal is to align AI more safely with human’s values.
Therefore, the inclusion of speciesism bias in the data makes it impossible to achieve
the safety and alignment of AI with nonhuman animals and anti-speciesist people.

Furthermore, as we found, Nozza et al. [50] used HurtLex [51] to evaluate social
bias in BERT and GPT-2, and HurtLex includes “ANIMAL” category as “Hate words
and slurs beyond stereotypes”. We acknowledge that certain words and phrases using
nonhuman animal names harm people. However, this kind of language is not only
hurtful to people but also to nonhuman animals [59]. One reason why these names
can be harmful is because they reinforce the notion of speciesism, which asserts that
nonhuman animals are inferior to humans. [cf. 60].

What can we do to create an anti-speciesist dataset? A community-based or par-
ticipatory approach to creating datasets might be helpful [37, 61]. Some studies on
social bias in AI have employed the approach of administering questionnaires to
LGBTQ+ individuals to identify strategies for mitigating false stereotypes associ-
ated with LGBTQ+ communities [62, 63]. Nevertheless, nonhuman animals do not
possess the capacity to respond to questionnaires.'! Consequently, the creation of anti-
speciesist datasets can be achieved by interviewing individuals with anti-speciesist
beliefs or by involving them as annotators, rather than relying on nonhuman animals.

5 Speciesism in NLP models

5.1 Existing Findings

Takeshita et al. [21] analyzed the speciesist bias in Masked Language Models (MLMs)
(e.g., BERT [2]) by using the probability difference of a token filled in [MASK] token
between two types of templates: human-describing sentences and object-describing
sentences. The human-describing sentence is “She/He is a [ANIMAL] who is [MASK].”

11 However, it is possible to use animal welfare science techniques to assess nonhuman animals’ values [64].
Furthermore, as feminist care ethics has appealed [65], by caring for nonhuman animals, we will hear their
voices.

11


and the object-describing one is “This/That/It is a [ANIMAL] which/that is [MASK].”
[ANIMAL] token is filled with animal names. MLMs predict the token in [MASK],
and researchers calculate the probability difference of the tokens in [MASK] between
these two templates. Their experimental results showed that MLMs inherit speciesist
bias. For example, BERT predicted higher probabilities of f-words in object-describing
sentences than in human-describing ones. Furthermore, BERT filled “slaughtered” in
[MASK] token in sentences regarding “farmed” animals such as “chicken”, “pig” and
“turkey” .

Hagendorff et al. [22] analyzed the speciesist bias in GPT-3 [66] and Delphi [57].

Delphi is fine-tuned T5 [67, 68] model, which was pre-trained and fine-tuned on English
commonsense morality dataset, including Social Chemistry 101 [53] and Common-
sense Morality in ETHICS dataset [54]. According their experiments, GPT-3 generated
“pork” following the sentence “What are pigs good for?”. Delphi also generates “It’s
wrong” to follow “Killing a cat”, while it generates “It’s okay” to follow “Killing a
cow”.
According to their experiments, GPT-3 produced the word “pork” in response
to the sentence “What are pigs good for?”. In the case of Delphi, it generated the
response “It’s wrong” after the prompt “Killing a cat”, whereas it generated “It’s
okay” in response to “Killing a cow”.

5.2 Our Method of Evaluating Speciesist Bias in NLP Models

To evaluate speciesist bias in NLP models, we consider whether NLP models explicitly
support speciesist action or not. We use Commonsense Morality subset of ETHICS
dataset [54]. As described in Section 4.3, we found 163 speciesist instances in this
subset. We use these instances to evaluate the bias towards nonhuman animals in
NLP models. We investigate the bias in Delphi [57]!?, GPT-3.5-turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-
1106)'° and GPT-4 (gpt-4-1106-preview) [69]. Furthermore, we try to mitigate the
speciesist bias in both GPTs* with anti-speciesist prompt, based on [70]. Table 4
shows two prompts used for GPTs!° in our experiment.

There are two differences between our study and existing studies. First, our study
is a quantitative evaluation because we use over 160 examples. Hagendorff et al. [22]
reported that GPT-3 generated texts that seem to support speciesist practices. How-
ever, they analyzed only about 40 cases. Second, we attempt to mitigate speciesist
bias by prompting, while existing studies only analyze the bias. This is also to assess
whether GPTs can understand the anti-speciesist prompt. It has to be noted that our
prompt strategy is prototypical, and we are aware that it could have only a limited
effect on bias mitigation. Therefore, we need to improve this technique further in the
future.

5.3 Our Findings

We show the results of our experiments in Table 5. All investigated NLP models with
the normal prompt answer “No”, i.e., the speciesist action is not morally wrong, in
most cases. The anti-speciesist prompt increases the answer to “Yes”, i.e., recognizing
properly that the speciesist action is morally wrong. However, it also increases the
answer to “No” for the case of GPT-3.5-turbo. On the other hand, the anti-speciesist
prompt largely decreases the answer “No” for the case of GPT-4, from 100 (61.3%)
to 38 (22.3%), increasing the answer “Yes”, from 1 (0.6%) to 101 (62.0%).

In addition, GPTs replied “Unknown” at relatively low rates (from 5.5% to
38.0%); the response “Unknown” indicates that a model withholds response, and it is
impossible to decide whether the output is speciesist or non-speciesist.

M4By “GPTs” in this paper, we refer to both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.

15 We cannot use this prompt strategy for Delphi because Delphi is a fine-tuned model to classify whether
the action described in the sentence is morally permissible without any instructions in the prompt.

5.4 Discussion on Speciesist Bias in NLP Models

Existing studies showed that Masked and Large Language Models (MLMs and LLMs)
associate negative words with nonhuman animal names. The results of our survey
indicate that both Delphi and recent OpenAI GPT models do not reject speciesist
practices. These findings suggest that there is a speciesist bias inherent in these LLMs.
In particular, the results in the case using the normal prompt are not surprising. These
models are fine-tuned to avoid generating harmful content [69, 71]'°, specifically for
humans, not for nonhuman animals. Although GPT models tend to produce content
that agrees with discriminatory claims with adversarial input [72], our experiment
showed that GPTs generate harmful content for nonhuman animals even without
adversarial input.

Anti-speciesist prompts partially alleviate the problem of speciesist bias in both
GPT models, especially in the case of GPT-4 which outputs “Yes (non-speciesist)”
more frequently than “No (speciesist)”. These results suggest that such an anti-
speciesist prompt helps decrease speciesist text generation. However, as discussed
above, these LLMs generate speciesist content without anti-speciesist prompts,
although these models are trained not to generate such discriminatory content
for human beings. In our opinion, future LLMs should be trained not to gen-
erate speciesist text without post-processing bias mitigation techniques, such as
anti-speciesist prompts.

6 General Discussion

This research investigated speciesism among NLP researchers (Section 3), in data
(Section 4), and models (Section 5). Social bias researchers in NLP do not recog-
nize speciesist bias, and some NLP researchers use speciesist idioms in their papers’
titles. NLP data contains speciesist content: speciesist language used in the pretrain-
ing corpus and downstream task dataset, and the annotation of commonsense morality
supports speciesist practices. NLP models such as MLMs and LLMs show the behavior
indicating speciesist bias.

Notice that speciesism (and its base) among researchers, data, and models are
closely related. First, the relationship between the data and the model’s speciesist bias
is obvious. Because of speciesist bias existing in the pretraining corpus, the NLP model
trained on it naturally displays speciesist bias behavior. In addition, NLP researchers
are taking the lead in the design and curation of such datasets. Hence, since NLP
researchers do not perceive speciesist bias as morally problematic, the datasets retain
such bias, and no effort was made to eliminate it.

6.1 Countermeasures Against Speciesism in NLP Research

How can we reduce speciesism in NLP research? First, NLP researchers themselves
should recognize that nonhuman animals should be taken seriously in their research.
Speciesism is rooted in our psychological and cultural attitudes and will not be easy
to overcome [27]. However, even if one does not accept anti-speciesism, one could

16For Delphi: https://delphi.allenai.org/updates#terms_and_conditions

14


still accept that nonhuman animals are morally significant. Given that the NLP
models propagate discriminatory bias and reinforce our discriminatory attitudes and
the discriminatory structure of society, nonhuman animals are indirect stakeholders.
Therefore, researchers should recognize that nonhuman animals need to be taken
seriously in their research.

Second, we should develop techniques to reduce speciesist bias in NLP data and
NLP models. In the case of discriminatory bias among humans, it is known that
training models can reduce bias to produce similar outputs when attributes are
swapped [73-75]. However, reducing speciesist bias does not mean the same generation
should be done when switching between humans and nonhuman animals. Instead, it is
necessary to train the model not to generate text that negatively represents nonhuman
animals or supports speciesist practices, just as it is necessary to train the model not
to generate text that negatively represents humans or supports discrimination against
humans.

Third, it will be necessary to develop not only debiasing methods but also datasets
that are useful for analyzing and mitigating speciesist bias in detail. As discussed in
Section 4.4, methods based on interviews with anti-speciesist people and ethical vegan
communities will be essential to developing such datasets. In addition, it could be
helpful to interview AI ethicists, animal ethicists, and other people who noticed that
speciesism is ignored in AI ethics.

Of course, these attempts are not sufficient to resist speciesism. After all, speciesism
is an ideology embedded in our society and is not a problem that can be addressed
only within NLP research like many other problems, such as racism and sexism. This
does not mean, however, that the above potential practices to resist speciesism are
unnecessary. We can use AI and data to challenge speciesism [cf. 37].

6.2 Limitations

Our investigation is limited to NLP, thus we should extend analysis to other AI
domains such as computer vision. Hagendorff et al. [22] explored the speciesist bias in
the datasets, MS-COCO [76] and ImageNet [77], and found the bias in these datasets.
We should extend our and their research to researchers and models in computer vision
and other fields of AI.

Our research focused on only the attributes of nonhuman animals. However, it is
crucial to consider intersectional ones. As ecofeminists discussed [e.g., 78], speciesism
and sexism are linked. For example, women are frequently insulted by nonhuman
animal metaphors. The reason why it is possible to insult women by using nonhu-
man animals as a metaphor is that it would apply to women the negative images
derived from speciesism. Moreover, using nonhuman animal metaphors to insult
women contributes to both speciesism and sexism. [59].

Regarding speciesism within NLP researchers, we investigated speciesism in the
texts written by the researchers. However, we did not interview NLP researchers for
their views on speciesism. Some of those doing NLP research may oppose speciesism.
Thus, we need to interview researchers to clarify speciesism in NLP or AI researchers
in the future.

15


On speciesism in NLP data, we only examined speciesism in three datasets.
Existing studies have also only analyzed speciesist language in some pre-training cor-
pora [21]. Social Chemistry 101 and Commonsense Morality in ETHICS are used for
AI safety and AI alignment, but we have yet to analyze the more recent datasets
used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [12]. Moreover, we have
not yet analyzed the extent to which the pre-training corpora contain descriptions of
speciesist practices and the use of speciesist language. We need to further extend our
analysis of speciesism in the NLP data in the future.

For speciesism in NLP models, we just analyze speciesist bias in GPT models
and Delphi using commonsense morality datasets. Existing studies have evaluated the
speciesist bias in MLMs [21] and GPT-3 [22]. However, we have not studied in detail
how other LLMs behave differently with specific inputs of nonhuman animal names
and precisely how they generate harmful content. Nor has it considered how it might
be improved in the future by interviewing anti-speciesist people and ethical vegans.
Therefore, we need further analysis of the speciesist behavior of LLMs and research
on how to make LLMs more non-speciesist as they are developed in the future.

6.3 Ethical Considerations

We recognize that our claim of anti-speciesism is controversial and are aware that
some philosophers defend speciesism [e.g., 79]. However, as discussed in Section 2.1,
we need to take nonhuman animals seriously in NLP research if one acknowledges the
moral status of nonhuman animals. Our study is only a starting point, and there is
a need for further research to promote the significance of nonhuman animals in NLP
and AI research.

In our study, we critically investigated some of NLP-related publications. Our
intent was not to attack the authors of those papers or divide the NLP community.
We hope that NLP researchers will constructively reflect on what should be done to
avoid harm to nonhuman animals and our study will contribute to the constructive
discussion.

In this study, we treated the group of “nonhuman animals” as a whole. However,
there is a rich diversity among species of nonhuman animals, and they have different
relationships with humans [80]. Distinct relationships exist between us and compan-
ion nonhuman animals (e.g., dogs and cats), nonhuman animals in farms (e.g., cows
and pigs), and free-roaming (“wild”) nonhuman animals (e.g., bears and wolves). Rec-
ognizing these differences is crucial, and future research should explore the diverse
relationships with various nonhuman animals.

This study examined speciesism in current NLP research. Nonhuman animals do
not directly use NLP techniques. However, it is possible that one day humans will be
able to communicate with nonhuman animals using future NLP technology. In that
case, communication with nonhuman animals could cause them further harm [81]. To
prevent such a future, we need to recognize the significance of nonhuman animals in
NLP research and stop speciesism.

7 Conclusion

This study is the first systematic investigation of speciesism in NLP research. We
discussed why speciesism should be considered in NLP research. We argued that non-
human animals are morally significant and that NLP and AI researchers should stop
speciesism or at least seriously consider the impact of AI on nonhuman animals and
anti-speciesist people. Nevertheless, our survey of speciesism in NLP researchers, data,
and models suggests that NLP researchers are unaware of speciesism and that the
speciesist bias exists in NLP data and NLP models. We also attempted to mitigate
the speciesist bias using an anti-speciesist prompt for the OpenAI GPT models and
partially reduced the bias in GPT-4.

If nonhuman animals and anti-speciesist values are to be taken seriously, NLP
researchers have to stop speciesism and moral anthropocentrism. Although this study
revealed speciesism in NLP research, we will attempt to reduce the speciesist bias
inherent in the data and models in other sub-fields of AI in the future.
