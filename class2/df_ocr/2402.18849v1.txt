1. INTRODUCTION

In the fields of digital communication and data security, image steganography plays an indispensable role [1][2]. As a
means of hiding information, it allows for the transmission of data without drawing attention, complementing encryption
technology. With the growing demand for information security in recent years, research and applications of image
steganography have attracted widespread attention [3][4].

Among various steganography methods, the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm has become a hot research topic due
to its simplicity and efficiency [5][6]. This method embeds secret information by modifying the least significant bit of
image pixels, usually causing minimal visual impact on the image [7]. However, when steganographic images undergo
common image processing such as compression, scaling, and noise addition, the embedded information often gets
damaged, affecting the integrity and readability of the information [8].

Despite the excellent performance of LSB steganography in hiding information, it has evident shortcomings in the
robustness of information extraction [9]. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when dealing with Chinese
characters, whose complex encoding can make it difficult for traditional error recovery techniques to accurately
reconstruct the original information once it is damaged [10]. Therefore, seeking a method that improves the robustness of
steganographic text extraction has become particularly important. The rapid development of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) technology in recent years, especially the emergence of large pretrained models like GPT-3.5 and
BERT, offers a new perspective for addressing this issue [11][12]. These models show remarkable abilities in semantic
understanding, text generation, error detection, and correction, bringing new possibilities for improving the accuracy and
robustness of steganographic text extraction.

This study aims to explore the potential of combining LSB steganography technology with large NLP models,
particularly in the extraction process of Chinese character steganographic text. We propose a new method (LSB-NLP
hybrid framework) that utilizes large NLP models for error detection and correction, semantic consistency analysis, and


information reconstruction to address the damage issues in the steganography process. This paper will detail the design,
implementation, and evaluation of this method, as well as a comparative analysis with traditional methods, to
demonstrate its advantages and potential in improving the accuracy of steganographic text extraction.

2. CONSTRUCTION OF A BENCHMARK MODEL FOR LSB CHINESE
STEGANOGRAPHY

In this section, we delve into the establishment of an efficient and covert method of information hiding, namely using the
Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique to embed Chinese text into images.

2.1 Binary Conversion of Text

In the steganography process, the primary task is converting Chinese text into a binary string suitable for embedding in
an image. Given the relative complexity of Chinese character encoding, we adopt UTF-8 encoding for this conversion,
ensuring that each Chinese character is accurately transformed into its corresponding binary sequence. The specific
conversion steps are as follows:

1.UTF-8 Encoding Conversion: Firstly, the Chinese text is converted using UTF-8 encoding. This step ensures that all
characters in the text can be represented in bytes.

2.Byte Sequence Processing: Each UTF-8 encoded character is converted into one or more bytes. We extract these byte
sequences for further processing.

3.Byte to Binary Conversion: Next, each byte is further converted into an 8-bit binary representation.

This conversion process not only ensures that Chinese characters can be correctly encoded but also provides a solid
foundation for the subsequent embedding process. The use of UTF-8 encoding allows us to handle various Chinese
characters and special symbols, thereby enhancing the applicability and flexibility of the steganography system.

2.2 Steganography of Text

We embed the binary data processed in 2.1 into the pixels of the target image. The primary characteristics of the UTF-8-
LSB algorithm are as follows:

1.Pixel-level Embedding: In this study, images are processed pixel by pixel, starting from the top left corner and
scanning row by row to the bottom right. For each pixel, we slightly adjust the least significant bit of its RGB value to
embed the binary data. This minor adjustment barely affects the visual quality of the image. By making only small
changes at the least significant bit, we maintain the image's appearance virtually unchanged.

2.Data Embedding Algorithm: To achieve efficient data embedding, we have designed the UTF-8-LSB algorithm. These
algorithms ensure that a significant amount of data can be successfully embedded even in localized areas of the image,
thus improving the efficiency of steganography. Our algorithms take into account the characteristics of the image to
minimize the impact on image quality.

3.Preservation of Visual Quality: During the steganography process, special attention is paid to preserving the visual
quality of the image. Our algorithms and methods are designed to ensure that the steganographic image is nearly
indistinguishable from the original, preventing the detection of embedded data. This is due to the nature of LSB
embedding in the least significant bit, which makes the human eye insensitive to the changes before and after.

2.3. Extraction of Text Post-Steganography

In steganography, the extraction of information is one of the key components of steganographic techniques. This section
will detail how to successfully extract the embedded Chinese text from a steganographic image. The specific extraction
steps are as follows:

1.Image Data Reading: The first step in the extraction process is to read the image containing the steganographic
information. At this stage, we only obtain the pixel data of the image without altering its visual characteristics.

2.Pixel-level Extraction: Starting from the top left corner of the image and scanning row by row to the bottom right, we
extract the least significant bit of the RGB value of each pixel. This method allows for the accurate restoration of the
embedded binary data.


3.Data Decoding: The extracted binary data needs to be further decoded to restore the Chinese text. We use the same
encoding format as during embedding, i.e., UTF-8 encoding, to convert the binary data back into Chinese characters.

4 Integrity Check of Information: During the extraction process, we perform an integrity check of the information to
ensure that the extracted text is complete. This includes checking for the presence of a predefined end marker to signify
the successful extraction of all embedded text.

2.4 Accuracy Test of Extraction

In the field of information steganography, extraction accuracy is one of the key indicators of the performance of a
steganography system. Before testing, we perform the extraction process of the post-steganography image, restoring the
steganographic information to text. The extracted text is then compared with the original Chinese text. We will use a
comparison algorithm to compare the extracted text with the original text character by character to determine their
consistency. The extraction accuracy can be calculated using the following formula:

Accuracy=N /T
Here, “N” represents the number of characters correctly extracted, and “T” represents the total number of characters.
2.5 Model Results

In this study, we used the standard test image from Lenna [13] for steganography testing. To evaluate the effectiveness
and covertness of the steganography technique, a text of 10,000 characters in length was embedded into this image.
Visually, the steganographic image is almost indistinguishable from the original, demonstrating that the steganography
technique successfully hides a substantial amount of textual information while maintaining image quality.

As part of the quantitative evaluation, Mean Square Error (MSE) was used as the primary metric. The calculated MSE
value is 0.2268, which is considered extremely low in the field of steganography, indicating very minimal pixel-level
differences between the original and the steganographic images. This low MSE value further attests to the high
covertness of the steganography technique used and its minimal impact on the original image quality.

Figure 1. Original Image (left) and Image with 10,000 Characters Embedded (right)

The accuracy of text extraction from the steganographic image reached 100%, demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy
of the steganography system in information extraction. This implies that the system is capable of losslessly recovering
hidden information, ensuring data integrity and reliability in transmission.

In summary, these results indicate that the steganography model excels in covertness, preservation of image quality, and
accuracy of data recovery. Therefore, it can be considered efficient and practical for high-capacity data steganography
tasks.

3. CONSTRUCTION OF AN NLP MODEL FOR STEGANOGRAPHY EXTRACTION

In this section, we introduce the construction and application of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model specifically
designed for extracting steganographic information. This part will explore the core concepts of the NLP model, its
improvements in handling garbled text extraction, and testing of the model.


3.1 Introduction to the NLP Model

We have chosen an NLP model based on the Transformer architecture to address the challenges of extracting
steganographic information. Known for its superior sequential modeling capabilities and parallel computing advantages,
the Transformer model is suitable for various NLP tasks. The architecture of this NLP model is based on the Self-
Attention mechanism, allowing the model to maintain global context in processing variable-length input sequences. The
model captures semantic information in the input sequence through multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward
neural networks, mapping it to a high-dimensional embedding space. The input structure of the model includes garbled
text extracted from steganographic images, which are divided into different tokens for the model to process. The output
structure involves understanding the garbled text and mapping it back to natural language text.

During training, we used a large-scale Chinese text dataset to fine-tune the model's parameters to adapt to the task of
extracting steganographic information. The training process involved optimizing the model's loss function to maximize
its understanding and accuracy in extracting steganographic information. Unlike traditional NLP, our model includes a
fine-tuning mechanism and uses a large amount of correct steganographic answers and data extracted via LSB for testing,
significantly improving the model's accuracy in extracting image steganography. This is due to its self-attention
mechanism, which enables it to handle the contextual relationships in garbled text, thereby improving accuracy.
Additionally, the model's deep structure allows it to learn complex semantic representations, aiding in handling semantic
consistency in steganographic information. The improvement in accuracy is attributed to the low correlation between the
garbled text and the original text. The NLP model increases the readability of the original text by correcting words based
on context. Even if the corrected characters do not match the correct characters, it does not reduce the extraction
accuracy.

3.2 NLP Changes in Garbled Text Extraction Training

Traditional NLP models may face challenges due to the discontinuity and garbled nature of text resulting from
steganography. Therefore, we implemented a series of improvements to enhance the NLP model's understanding and
accuracy in extracting garbled text.

In training the NLP model, we improved data preprocessing to adapt to the specific nature of garbled text. Firstly, we
introduced a special data cleaning step for handling special characters, symbols, and formats in steganographic
information. This helps reduce misunderstandings by the model during extraction. Secondly, we tokenized the garbled
text, breaking it down into smaller units corresponding to partial vocabulary, character fragments, or specific encoding
sequences. Tokenization allows the model to better capture local patterns and associations in steganographic information,
thus improving extraction precision.

To adapt the NLP model to the task of extracting garbled text, we adopted a carefully designed fine-tuning strategy.
During the model fine-tuning stage, we introduced labels for steganographic information to guide the model in
understanding garbled text. These labels indicate to the model which parts are steganographic information and which are
normal text, enabling the model to more accurately identify and extract steganographic information. Furthermore, we
conducted multiple rounds of iterative fine-tuning to gradually improve the model's performance on the garbled text
extraction task. Each round of fine-tuning involved minor adjustments to the model's parameters to better adapt to the
characteristics of steganographic information.

Finally, to further enhance the NLP model's performance, we conducted specific feature engineering for garbled text.
This included introducing specially designed features to capture patterns and semantic associations in steganographic
information. The goal of these feature engineering efforts was to enhance the model's robustness and accuracy in the task
of extracting garbled text.

4. INTEGRATION OF LSB CHINESE WITH NLP MODEL

In this section, we combine LSB Chinese steganography with the NLP model to construct a powerful framework for
extracting steganographic information. This framework combines the high covertness of LSB steganography with the
text comprehension ability of the NLP model, providing a comprehensive and effective solution for the extraction of
steganographic information.


4.1 LSB-NLP Framework

The core idea of the LSB-NLP framework is to use LSB steganography for embedding Chinese text into the least
significant bits of pixels in an image, while utilizing the NLP model for text extraction and restoration. This framework
includes the following key steps:

1.Text Embedding (LSB Steganography): First, the Chinese text, after specific encoding and conversion, is embedded
into the least significant bit of the pixels in the target image. This step ensures the concealment of the data while not
significantly affecting the visual quality of the image.

2.Image Storage: The image with embedded text is saved and can be used for subsequent extraction processes.

3.Text Extraction (NLP Model): In the extraction phase, we use the NLP model to extract the steganographic Chinese
text from the embedded image. The NLP model is specially trained to adapt to the garbled and noisy characteristics of
steganographic information, thereby improving extraction accuracy.

4.2 Testing the Model

This section will detail the testing process and results of the LSB-NLP framework. We will use a series of
steganographic images with different characteristics and lengths to evaluate the framework's performance. The primary
objective of the test is to verify the accuracy of the framework.

In the tests, we will assess the accuracy and stability of the LSB-NLP framework in extracting different types of
steganographic information. We will also examine the framework's performance in the face of different character lengths
and noise, to determine its usability in complex scenarios. Under the interference of noise, by embedding texts of
different lengths, we compare the accuracy of the LSB steganography with the steganography algorithm based on the
LSB-NLP framework as shown in the following graph.

achieves high accuracy with different numbers of characters (10k characters - 19k characters). This indicates that the
LSB-NLP model can effectively extract steganographic information and has high accuracy.

framework's performance can be further optimized, extended to other languages and application areas, and research on
robustness and security can be strengthened. Additionally, considering the integration of more advanced deep learning
technologies to further enhance the processing capability of steganographic information is a viable avenue.

Overall, this study offers an effective solution to the issues of steganography and extraction of Chinese text, opening new
possibilities for research and applications in the field of information hiding. We look forward to future research
continuing to advance this field, contributing more to information security and privacy protection.
