Abstract

We study next-to-leading-power (NLP) threshold corrections in colour-singlet production pro-
cesses, with particular emphasis on Drell-Yan (DY) and single-Higgs production. We assess the
quality of the partonic and hadronic threshold expansions for each process up to NNLO. We
determine numerically the NLP leading-logarithmic (LL) resummed contribution in addition
to the leading-power next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (LP NNLL) resummed DY and Higgs
cross sections, matched to NNLO. We find that the inclusion of NLP logarithms is numeri-
cally more relevant than increasing the precision to N°LL at LP for these processes. We also
perform an analytical and numerical comparison of LP NNLL + NLP LL resummation in soft-
collinear effective theory and direct QCD, where we achieve excellent analytical and numerical
agreement once the NLP LL terms are included in both formalisms. Our results underline the
phenomenological importance of understanding the NLP structure of QCD cross sections.


1 Introduction

The convergence of perturbative calculations of hadronic cross sections in Quantum Chromody-
namics (QCD) is key to understanding the phenomenology of particle collisions at hadron colliders.
While the perturbative approach relying on the smallness of QCD coupling constant as is often
successful, its value in certain kinematic limits is conditional on the behaviour of logarithmic cor-
rections. A well-known example is the presence of logarithms of the threshold variable € in these
corrections. These logarithms grow large as € —> 0, ie. approaching the threshold boundary of
phase space. One may generically express the structure of the dimensionless partonic coefficient
function near threshold as

m=0 m=0

The first term on the right is the class of leading-power (LP) contributions, while the second consists
of constants localized at € = 0. The former contributions are well-studied and originate from the
phase-space difference between virtual and real-emission diagrams after the KLN cancellation and
mass factorisation of the soft and collinear singularities takes place. While singular in the € > 0
limit, they are regularized by the plus prescription, which makes them integrable. Long ago it was
realized that the predictive power of the perturbative approach may be saved by resumming the
logarithmic enhancements to all orders in as, first to leading logarithmic (LL) order (22), and soon
after extended to subleading logarithmic accuracies (3}(4). These initial results have been re-derived
and generalized using either different techniques in direct QCD (dQCD) or the Soft-Collinear-
Effective Theory (SCET) approach (3).

The third set of terms in eq. is down by a single power in € with respect to the first. These are
the so-called next-to-leading power (NLP) contributions and are the main focus of this work. On the
formal side, conjectures on the exponential structure of NLP contributions have already appeared
in various places (9}{27], and have been been proven at NLP LL accuracy for the DY and Higgs
production cross sections using two methods. In ref. NLP LL resummation was achieved for
general colour-singlet production processes using diagrammatic techniques in the (QCD framework.
NLP resummation is also achieved in SCET, both for the DY and Higgs production
processes |"| Note that these methods resum NLP LL terms that originate from next-to-soft gluon
emissions only. A general resummation framework for soft-quark emissions is still under development
(see e.g. for recent process in the SCET framework).

Despite this interest in the behaviour of the NLP terms, relatively few studies focus on their
numerical /phenomenological aspects. Early numerical studies on the threshold approximation of
the Drell-Yan (DY) production process already noted the importance of subleading-power log-
arithms [33] [34]. Threshold expansions of the Higgs next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and
N°LO coefficient functions are studied in (35}37], showing that the convergence of this series is
slow, thereby stressing the importance of NLP contributions. In ref. (9], the LP resummation
formalism was extended to include subleading contributions for the DY and Higgs production pro-
cesses, and found that these impact the final result significantly. In ref. it was found that
the way one handles NLP contributions results in ambiguity of the LP resummed result, and that

‘Note that besides the threshold regime, resummation of NLP logarithm has been obtained in SCET also for
thrust [22]. Fixed-order NLP corrections for DY and single Higgs production have also been studied in SCET for the

N-jettiness and the qr of the produced lepton pair/Higgs boson (2829).


the numerical difference that follows from this ambiguity is of phenomenological relevance for both
DY and Higgs|*| In numerical effects of subleading powers were studied for prompt photon
production. All these studies point in the same direction: although not as divergent as the LP
contributions, numerically NLP terms can become quite important.

Motivated by these considerations, we aim to answer three questions in this paper. First, what
is the behaviour of the threshold expansion of the DY and Higgs partonic coefficient functions?
Second, what is the numerical impact of NLP LL resummation in dQCD, and how does it compare
to that of subleading logarithmic corrections at LP? And finally, to what extent do the d(QCD and
SCET NLP resummation formalisms agree, analytically and numerically?

The outline of this paper is then as follows. In Section [2] we study the convergence of the fixed-
order DY and Higgs expansions at threshold; for the DY threshold expansion this, to the best of
our knowledge, has not been shown earlier (neither for the diagonal nor off-diagonal production
channels). For the aaa case in the dominant production channel, we confirm results that have
appeared earlier In Section |3} [3] we review and nut fn improve LP and NLP resummation
for these processes, a derive the resummation exponent (eq. (49)) ) that is used for our numerical
studies. These are presented in Section [4] 4| where we show the impact of the NLP LL resummation
on top of the LP NNLL(’) resummed se matched DY and Higgs cross sections. We also present
an assessment of the numerical importance for off-diagonal emissions, for which no resummation
has been achieved yet In Section |5| we perform a careful comparison of (QCD and SCET re-
summation to LP NNLL plus NLP LL accuracy. We summarize and conclude in Section |6| while
certain technical aspects and collections of relevant perturbative coefficients can be found in three
appendices.

2 Threshold expansions at fixed order

In this section we study the convergence of the threshold expansion in fixed order calculations for
the single Higgs and the DY processes, first at the parton level, and subsequently for the hadronic
cross section. The partonic flux plays an important role in the threshold expansion of the latter.

While earlier studies (see e.g. [91/33] 48]) have addressed partonic and/or hadronic threshold

expansions for one or both of these processes, we provide here an extended analysis tailored to study
NLP corrections. As such it also serves as an introduction to the numerical study of NLP effects in
resummed cross sections in section [4]

2.1 Threshold behaviour of the partonic coefficients for single Higgs production

We start with the study of the behaviour of the partonic coefficient functions for single Higgs
production at NLO and NNLO (47(52I[53}. First we introduce some relevant quantities and

variables. The hadronic cross section for this process is given by

where T = me /S, with mp, the Higgs boson mass and S the hadronic center-of-mass (CM) energy

coefficient function. Note that the leading order (LO) partonic cross section of is factored out. In

the infinite top-mass limit [Ait reads (see e.g. ref. (52})

in units of GeV~?. The strong coupling is denoted by as = as5(), Ne is the number of colours,
and Fermi’s constant Gr has the value 1.16639 - 10-° GeV~?. Throughout this paper we employ
the central member of the PDF4LHC15 NNLO 100 PDF set for proton-proton collisions with
VS = 13 TeV, corresponding to as(M?) = 0.118 with the Z-boson mass Mz = 91.18 GeV. In
practice we use a polynomial fit of these PDFs (see appendix [A}, which is particularly convenient
for obtaining the resummed results presented in section We choose the renormalisation and
factorisation scale equal and denote both as y. The threshold variable is 1 — z = 1 — nie /s, with

from the functions nf (2) eq. (45)-(57) in ref. [52]. We note that the factor of 1/z appearing in

eq. (15) of that reference is included in our partonic coefficient functions, i.e. we have |

In our threshold expansion the factor 1/z is expanded too, an approach also taken in (47, following
[43]. One may choose to keep that factor unexpanded. This would lead to somewhat different
results, a consequence of truncating the expansion eq. (8). Let us comment here further on the role
of the extra factor of 1/z. In general, one may define the partonic coefficient functions to contain
additional powers of 1/z, provided a compensating factor is introduced. For some power p we would

If one expands the term in square brackets around threshold and truncate that series at some power
in (1 — z), the above result is no longer equal to eq. (4), and is thus sensitive to the p additional
inverse powers of z that are expanded

This makes results of threshold expansions somewhat ambiguous, an aspect also discussed at length
in ref. (see in particular the caption of fig. 2 in that reference). In our case we fix the power
of 1/z by requiring the universality of LL NLP terms in the dominant channel of colour singlet
production processes, as shown in at fixed order, as well as in in a resummation context.
In both DY and Higgs production the coefficients of the highest power of In(1 — z) at LP and NLP
are, at each order in as, identical but with opposite sign. This follows from both terms resulting
from multiplying the same residual collinear singularity with an overall e-dependent power of (1—z).
This singularity, which is absorbed in the PDF by mass factorisation, is associated to the lowest-
order splitting kernel, such that the logarithms in the finite part are indirectly generated a the

splitting kernel too, as is well known. Expansion of the lowest order splitting function, PA and

Pi for DY and Higgs respectively, reveals that they indeed obey this relation between the LP and
NLP terms

where we have expanded around threshold in the second line, and where we observe the advertised
relation between the coefficient of the LL at LP and NLP.
We now examine how well the partonic coefficient functions are approximated by the threshold
expansion at NLO and NNLO order, for each partonic channel. Our default scale choice is uw = mp.

In fig.|1h and b we show the threshold expansion of the two NLO coefficients ANY . and At? a The

third partonic NLO channel (qq) only contributes at N*LP, hence we leave it out of our discussion’

®This is because this channel corresponds to the s-channel process gg > g — gh, which is proportional to eee
with s, ¢ and wu Mandelstam variables. Parametrizing t and u as t = —s(1— z)v and u = —s(1 — z)(1 —v), this leads


We show the results without the 6(1 — z) term, which is present in the gg-channel. In fig.
and d we show the equivalent NNLO results. Considering the gg-initiated channel first (fig.
and fig. |1 ie, we observe that the LP threshold expansion of Al hy 9 deviates considerably from the
unexpanded result in the z > 1 limit, which might be surprising at first sight. This is caused
by the NLP terms: In’ (1 — z) terms do not vanish as z — 1, and are not captured by the LP
truncation of the matrix element. Although subdominant to the LP contribution, they are not
altogether negligible as z + 1. The unexpanded NLO result is however well-described by the NLP
approximation for z = 0.2. None of the truncations captures the behaviour below z S 0.2 well,
due to the factor of 1/z in the partonic coefficient function. The threshold expansion of the NNLO
coefficient function Ae? : , performs worse (fig. than that of the NLO coefficient function: the
LP approximation underestimates the unexpan aed result in the large-z domain, while the NLP
approximation overestimates it. Convergence is seemingly only obtained at NNLP.

Turning to the qg-channel (fig. (Ib), whose LP approximation vanishes, we see that the NLP
approximation overestimates the unexpanded result in the large-z domain. Also here the small-z
domain is poorly described by the z — 1 expansion of the full partonic coefficient function due to
a 1/z factor. The NNLO gg coefficient function (fig. shows similar behaviour.

2.2 Threshold behaviour of the partonic coefficient functions for Drell-Yan

invariant mass Q? is given by

with z = am The as expansion of Apy,;;(z) is similar to eq. (6), and the threshold expansion
of Apyij(z) is as in eq. (8). The coefficient AO, ij() is given by digdjq6(1 — 2) by extracting in
eq. (14) the prefactor (see appendix [B)

where apm = 1/127.94 is the electromagnetic fine-structure constant at the scale Mz. To compare
directly with single Higgs production we set = Q = mp for the discussion in this subsection.

In fig. [2a] and fig. we show the threshold expansions truncated up to NNLP of the NLO and
NNLO q@-channel, whose exact expressions are obtained from ref. [57]. Both perturbative orders
are well described by the NLP approximation for a large range of z-values. The convergence of the
threshold expansions of the gg-channel, shown in fig. [2b] and fig. is worse than for the dominant
qq-channel. In contrast to the Higgs case, the NLP approximation underestimates the Ag. a9 and

A a coefficients near z = 1. The NNLP expansion behaves slightly better, although convergence

is again slow for this channel. As for the Higgs case, the partonic channels (qq, gg) that open up at

NNLO do not contribute at NLP, as these channels require the emission of two soft quarks.
Recapitulating, for both single Higgs production and DY we have seen that the partonic thresh-

old expansion works best for the dominant production channel. The NLP truncation overestimates

to a factor (1 — z)? from the matrix element. An extra factor of (1 — z) follows from the phase space measure.

the coefficient functions for intermediate and large values of z in these dominant channels, but
convergence is reached at NNLP. In the qg-channels, the NLP expansion overestimates the exact
result for Higgs production for z + 1, while it underestimates it for DY. At NNLP no substantial
improvement is obtained in this channel. The contribution in the z — 0 region, corresponding to
the high-energy limit, is for Higgs production more pronounced than for DY, for both production
channels. This is due to the factor of 1/z that is part of the partonic coefficient function of the
former process, which magnifies small-z contributions. To what extent the various differences also
manifest themselves in hadronic cross sections depends of course on the parton flux. This question

is addressed in the next section.

2.3 Threshold expansions of the Higgs and DY hadronic cross sections

In the previous subsection it became clear that the Higgs partonic coefficient functions have a more
pronounced small-z contribution than those of DY. In the hadronic cross sections, these coefficient
functions are weighted by the parton flux as in eqs. and (14), which possibly affects the quality
of the threshold expansion for the hadronic cross section.

For non-singular terms in the partonic coefficient functions (those that do not contain plus-
distributions), the convolutions in eq. and eq. correspond to a point-by-point multiplication

with the parton luminosity function. The product, which is the integrand for the inclusive cross
section at fixed 7, is a function of z only. This weight distribution shows which parts of the coefficient
functions are enhanced or suppressed by the parton flux, and thus gives much information about how
well the threshold expansion can approximate the exact result. We emphasize that for understanding
the quality of the threshold expansion, only the shape of the weight distributions for the non-singular
contributions matters; the plus-distributions cannot be expanded any further in the threshold limit.
For completeness, we nevertheless review the weight distributions for these LP terms briefly, as
these notably involve the derivative of the parton flux, as well as the separately integrated partonic
coefficient function (see appendix |C). For brevity we denote the latter by

In fig. [3] we plot the resulting weight distribution for DY and Higgs production, up to NNLO and
for Q = 4 = mp. To aid comparison we normalize the plotted functions (generically denoted by

entiated qq-flux highlights the small-z region more than the differentiated gg-flux, as shown by the
dashed lines, but since the LP terms of the partonic coefficient functions for DY are small in that
regime (see fig. [2a] and fig. [2ch, this affects their product with the coefficient functions (solid lines)
only little. The product diverges (integrably so) for both channels for z > 1, as one would expect

for the LP terms. Overall, the LP behaviour of both processes is very similar. Around z ~ 0.8
a small difference appears, caused by the stronger decrease of the derivative of the gq-flux. This
results in a slightly more spread-out (i.e. less threshold-centered) weight distribution for DY, but
as we mentioned above, this cannot affect the quality of the threshold expansion. We point out
that, somewhat counter-intuitively, the LP terms make up only a modest fraction of the total cross
section, for both processes (we shall quantify this in fig. [8] and fig. (9).

In fig. |4| we show the normalized non-singular part of the partonic coefficient functions up to
NNLO, weighted by the respective parton luminosity (solid lines) We focus on the dominant
production channel for each process and show the z-dependence of the parton fluxes themselves
as well (dashed lines). In addition to the natural comparison scale for on-shell Higgs production
of Q = uw = 125 GeV (fig. [4ah, we also consider one off-shell Higgs-production scenario with
Q = uw = 500 GeV (fig. (4b). In both cases we see that the product of the parton luminosities
and the coefficient functions are suppressed in the small z regime, as a result of the small parton
flux. This, in turn, is due to the momentum fractions 7; and x2 being large when z — 7 since
x1£2 = ~. The individual sea quark and gluon PDFs are small in the large x domain, suppressing
the luminosity f} Larger values of y in the flux strengthen this suppression. Therefore, the singular
behaviour of the coefficient functions for single Higgs production near z = 0 is more suppressed by
the parton luminosity as yz increases. Thus at Q = = 125 GeV a notable peak is present in the
small z region (it is more pronounced at smaller ju values). It disappears due to the above-mentioned
suppression for larger js values, as seen in fig. [4b] for Q = 500 GeV. However, at Q = 125 GeV this
feature should still affect the quality of the threshold expansion for the hadronic Higgs cross section.

7Some contributions to the DY NNLO partonic coefficient in the qq channel ought to be summed over the quark
flavours without charge weighing (see appendix A of ref. [57|). We have explicitly verified that these terms contribute
only from N°LP onwards and that these contributions are numerically negligible. Therefore, the overall point-by-point
multiplication with the parton luminosity function in eq. is deemed to be a valid approximation.

’The valence quark contributions to the parton luminosity defined in eq. cause it to fall off less steeply with
x than for sea quarks (or gluons) alone. This is reflected in the stronger small-z suppression of the parton luminosity
for gg compared to qq.

Figure 5: Exact (solid lines) as well as truncated expressions at NLP (dotted) and NNLP (dashed) for
the non-singular part of the coefficient functions up to NNLO, weighted with the parton luminosity,
for the dominant channel of DY (qq, dark blue) and single Higgs (gg, light blue) production. All
curves are normalized according to eq. (17).

As the DY partonic coefficient function does not show singular behaviour in the small z-regime,
the p-dependent suppression of the parton luminosity has less impact and we expect the quality of
the threshold expansion to be mostly @-independent. Based on these considerations we therefore
expect that, especially for small-Q values, the quality of the threshold expansion of the dominant
channel for DY is better than that for Higgs production.

To test this expectation, we compare the parton-luminosity-weighted NLP and NNLP approxi-
mations of the partonic coefficient functions to the unexpanded NLO+NNLO result. This product,
being the (approximated) integrand of the non-singular (NS) contribution to the hadronic cross
section, is denoted by

Fig. |5| shows normalized plots of these quantities. We see that the weight distribution for DY
production is approximated well, for both Q values, by the NLP truncation over the full range of z.
At NNLP the agreement with the exact result is excellent. For Higgs production at Q = 125 GeV,
we again observe that the expansion does not capture the small-z region well, neither at NLP nor at
NNLP. The stronger parton luminosity suppression at Q = 500 GeV does aid the convergence, with
a NNLP truncation that is almost as good as for DY. Therefore, these plots confirm the expectation
that the threshold expansions works better for the dominant production channel of DY than for
Higgs production.

fig. |6] shows that the z-dependence of the qg-flux is not qualitatively different from the qq and gg

°We note that the parton luminosity shown is summed over the five lightest (anti)quark flavours. For DY this
luminosity function is weighted with the quark charge as well, but since this does not alter the line shape significantly,
we do not show it separately to improve readability.

the enhancement in that region from the factor of 1/z in the Higgs partonic coefficient function
is tempered. From fig. |7| we see that the power expansions approximate the full result less well
for these channels than for the dominant production channels. Moreover, while the NLP and
NNLP approximations for the Higgs qg-channel get significantly better for higher @ values, those
for the DY qg-channel do not, and the threshold expansion for Higgs outperforms the one for DY
at Q = 500 GeV. Again this is due to the parton luminosity suppression in the small z-region.
For Higgs production the truncated expression deviates most from the exact (N)NLO coefficient
function in this region, as seen in fig.|/1} while for DY (fig. |2)) this deviation is more spread out and
therefore benefits less from going to large @ values.

We note that the results presented in this subsection contain a level of detail that is of course
lost upon integration over z. As such, the integration over z may lead to a seemingly contradictory
result: cancellations between under- and overestimations of the exact result across the z domain
may cause crude approximations to look more favourable than expected. This is what we observe
in the next subsection, where we consider the quality of the threshold expansion of the integrated
hadronic cross section. For example, for Q = 125 GeV the integrated NLP truncation approximates
the exact NLO+NNLO result for the gg-channel in Higgs production better than the NNLP one,
as will be seen in fig.|8} since the more severe overshoot for z > 0.3 provides a better cancellation
for the undershoot at small z.

2.4 Convergence of the threshold expansion in integrated hadronic cross sec-
tions

We now turn our attention to the behaviour of the threshold expansions of the total hadronic cross
section, starting with single Higgs production. We show the expansions up to N?+!LP, which follows

be expanded around z = 1, we show this term separately if its coefficient is non-zero. As in the
previous subsection, we add the NLO and NNLO contributions in eq. (20), and we restrict our
discussion to those partonic channels that contribute at NLP.

The truncated cross sections can be seen in fig. |8} where the power expansions are shown up
to N?°LP. On the left-hand side of this figure, we show results for the gg-channel (up to NNLO)
for Q = 125 GeV. The LP expansion severely underestimates the unexpanded part of the hadronic
cross section (without the 6-contribution), while the NLP expansion overestimates it by a much
smaller amount. After including the NNLP term, the expansion stabilizes We also observe a
significant d-contribution, as is well known for this process.

For the qg-channel (right-hand side of fig. (8), we observe that the NLP truncation exactly
produces the unexpanded cross section. This is however somewhat of a coincidence: the (N)NLO
NLP truncation underestimates (overestimates) the magnitude of the negative unexpanded (N)NLO
contribution by a similar amount. When added together, these under- and overestimates cancel.
The NNLP truncation for the integrated cross section performs much worse, consistent with what
we predicted based on fig. An overestimate of the negative contribution from this channel
perseveres for higher-power truncations, and the expansion converges only very slowly to the full
result. Again, this is due to the NLO and NNLO coefficients having a negative contribution at
z —> 1, compensated by a large positive contribution for z — 0, which is however only slowly
reconstructed in a 1 — z expansion.

Also for DY production at Q = 125 GeV, the LP expansion of dominant channel is not a good
approximation of the exact cross section, as seen in the left-hand side of fig. 9] The NLP expansion
shows moderate overestimation, as seen in fig. [alas well, but performs significantly better already.
In general the power expansion converges quickly. For the qg-channel (right-hand side of fig. (9)
we see that the NLP (NNLP) expansion overestimates (underestimates) the absolute value of the

This is consistent with ref. (44), eq. (3) when we pick g(z) = 1.

the Higgs qg-channel, the threshold expansion does converge after including the N*LP contribution.

Before we conclude this section, we comment on the behaviour of the threshold expansions for
other values of Q. For the gg-channel in single Higgs production, the convergence of the threshold
expansion happens faster for higher values of Q, which is a direct consequence of the stronger 1/z
suppression of the gg luminosity function. Also for the Higgs qg-channel the threshold expansion
converges more slowly for small Q values than for larger ones, for the same reason. On the other
hand, the behaviour of the threshold expansion of the gg and qg DY channels marginally improves
at higher Q values. We conclude that the threshold expansion for NNLO cross sections is in general
more reliable for DY than for single Higgs production for both the dominant (qq/gg) and subleading
qg production channels.

3 NLP resummation in dQCD

Having exhibited the effect and quality of NLP approximations in fixed order cross sections, we now
turn to consider NLP effects for resummed cross sections. This section discusses analytical aspects
of NLP resummation in direct QCD (dQCD), whereas numerical results are shown in Section [4] We
concentrate on the dominant channels, and address LP and NLP resummation at the same time.

3.1 From LP to NLP resummation

Resummation in dQCD is customarily performed in Mellin-moment (JV) space, where the cross sec-
tion is a product of N-space functions. Thus, for the gluon-fusion contribution to Higgs production
in eq. (2) one obtains

1
O12 ngs) = [der opp onextt) = 08 lN M Fal Mw) Dao Q2/02), (21

and similarly for the DY production (with g > q and of > of’). We use a boldface notation for
Mellin-transformed quantities. To perform the resummation in N-space, one uses the resummed
perturbative coefficient Aga(N). The resummed hadronic cross section in momentum space is
obtained after taking the inverse Mellin transform

(99) doers —N (99)
x= f dN tr Op on4x (NV), (22)
where we choose the Minimal Prescription for the N integration contour. This corresponds
to choosing c = Cyyp to left of the large-N branch-cut (starting for us at the branch-point N =
exp [1/(2a,b9)]) originating from the Landau pole, but to the right of all other singularities. We note
that this approach works for both LP and NLP terms, as the branch cut is identical for both terms.
To minimize numerical instabilities, the integration contour is usually bent towards the negative
real axis. We include also N-space PDFs in our inverse Mellin transform, for which we use a fitted
form of the PDFs (see the discussion around eq. (131).

In ref. a resummed partonic coefficient for colour-singlet production processes was derived
that also incorporates the LL NLP contributions for the dominant channel

The exponent ELP+NLP contains the diagonal DGLAP splitting function P,,, expanded up to NLP
in the threshold variable. The factor of 2 multiplying this term reflects the initial state consisting
of identical partons (either gg or qq). The soft wide-angle contributions are collected in Daa(as).
Both terms are process-independent to the extent that they only depend on the colour structure of
the underlying hard-scattering process. The overall +-subscript denotes that the plus-prescription
needs to be applied to all LP contributions. After the Mellin transform has been carried out, the

15


DLP+NLP and ELP+NLP terms contain all logarithmic N dependence at LP and leading-logarithmic

N dependence at NLP. It also contains some contributions that are beyond LL NLP (i.e. the
argument of a, in the function Dgq creates NLP contributions beyond LL, as we will see, and so
does the 1/z-dependence of the upper limit of the kr integral). The process-dependent function
go(as) collects the N-independent contributions. For an N*LL resummation, we need this function
only up to O(a*), but if available we include the O(a”) terms as well, which upgrades N*LL to

N*LL’ resummation. The splitting function PLP+N"P can be written in the LP+NLP approximation

where the plus-prescription is already applied. We highlight two changes with respect to (23). The
first is that the splitting function is approximated to LP accuracy instead, removing the additional
—1 term of eq. (24). The second is that the upper limit of the kr integration on the second
line, reflecting the exact phase-space constraint on the soft emission, has been replaced by its
LP approximation. The same replacement has been made in the argument of a, in Daq on the
first line. How to calculate the integrals in eq. is outlined in ref. [4)/6}/62), and extended to
accommodate NLP contributions to the splitting function in ref. (12). However, the latter reference
did not implement the exact phase-space constraint. If one does, a simpler formula can be derived
that obtains the NLP contribution directly from the LP exponent using a derivative with respect
to the Mellin moment N, which we show in the next subsection.

‘We include the usual factor of 2 in eq. (23).

where we have separated the logarithms with scale-dependence from those with z-dependence. Since

only contribute at NLL accuracy and beyond (we would have obtained the same result by making

This method was proposed in [6] for the LP contributions D; and generalized to the NLP integrals
Jr in (11). The terms labeled by 7’; were not included before. Although of sub-leading logarithmic

accuracy, they are important for our final result. Expanding eq. around the limit N — oo
yields, up to O(1/N) corrections

Gp(N.n) = ! pC m) (1 | i 2) i . (35a)
Ga(N,n) = sea (35b)
Ga(N,n) = a. (35c)

We see that pure LP contributions in z-space, as contained in D;, give NLP contributions in Mellin
space (i.e. terms proportional to 1/N). In dQCD, the resummation is done in Mellin space, and
in what follows, when we refer to ‘NLP’ in dQCD, we mean terms that are proportional to 1/N.
We now observe that all O(1/N) terms can be generated from the LP contributions in N-space by
means of a derivative with respect to N

Note that this only holds when including 7’, as it cancels the 7? term in the square brackets of
eq. (35a). Taylor expansion of the LP contribution (i.e. the term in eq. without the derivative)
around 7 = 0 yields

limited by that of the LP function on which it acts. Therefore, this result is strictly of LL accuracy
at both LP and NLP. We will use the resulting NLP function for the numerical studies in section [4]

By using the full A(a,) function for EL? +N"P the result is straightforwardly extended to higher
logarithmic accuracy at LP, and including partial N‘LL NLP terms through the derivative in N of
the relevant LP resummation functions

This is valid to arbitrary LP logarithmic accuracy, and to NLP LL accuracy, as we do not have

For the wide-angle contribution in eq. (23), we can use the same method to arrive at a derivative

4 Numerical studies of LP and NLP resummation cross sections in

dQCD

Having set-up the formalism for (QCD resummation at NNLL’ at LP and NLP LL, we turn to
the numerical study of this formalism for various processes, in the context of LHC collisions at
VS = 13 TeV. We use fitted PDFs that allow for an analytical evaluation of the Mellin transform,
as explained in appendix [A] For DY and Higgs production we will show resummed observables that
are matched to the fixed-order result at NNLO. The matching is defined by

Note that we include the full fixed-order result in o(*e4 rder) i ¢, also the sub-dominant production

channels. The second term on the right is the expanded resummed observable. We calculate this
term by Taylor-expanding the resummed coefficient function in N-space

A4QCD,LP+NLP (N Q?/12)|

(fixed order)

where we only need the terms up to O(a”) for matching with an N”LO fixed-order calculation. The
result is substituted into eq. (21), after which the Mellin-space inversion is handled via eq. (22).
Terms that are of higher power than O(1/N) are created in the expansion (51). They are kept
in the matching and thus subtracted from the resummed result as they are also contained in the
complete fixed-order expression. We perform the LP resummation at NNLL’ accuracy, where NNLL’
resummation offers an improvement over NNLL by the inclusion of the exact N-independent terms
at NNLO (i.e. we include go up to O(a2)). This is not strictly necessary for NNLL resummation,
but it is relevant in case of large virtual corrections at the two-loop level, such as for single Higgs
production. We stress again that we only resum the channels that contribute at LP. To examine
the impact of NLP resummation on colour-singlet processes other than Drell-Yan or single Higgs
production, we also show at the end of this section results for di-boson and di-Higgs production,
which we include to LP NLL accuracy and do not match to fixed higher-order results.

4.1 Single Higgs production

To obtain the total resummed Higgs cross section in N-space, we start from eq.
Opp->n+X(N) = o0fy(N, MH) Fal Ns Aggy P(N, Q?/17) , (52)

with o? given in eq. and the resummed contribution AG??? ON, Q?/p7) of eq. with a = g.
As mentioned above we include go up to O(a2). We vary Q(= mp) with the aim of exploring the
resummation effects more widely a only for the physical scale Q = 125 GeV.

The results are shown in fig. where all lines have been normalized either to LO (a) or
NNLO (b (b). All resummed results are S aihdled to the NNLO fixed-order result. The large enhance-
ment due to the NNLL’ matched resummation with respect to the LO result is caused by the sizable
6(1 — z) contribution to both the NLO and NNLO fixed-order cross sections, which enter the re-
summed distribution via go(as). The enhancement of the LP NNLL’+ NLP LL resummed result,
with respect to the LO distribution (using = Q), is roughly 300 —360% in the considered Q range,
the strongest increase occurring for smaller Q values. When compared to the matched LP NNLL’

resummed cross section, we find an NLP enhancement between 4.3 — 6.3%, with larger effects for
smaller Q values. This increase can be contrasted with the effect of increasing the LP accuracy
to N38LL. To obtain this we need to include only the gS (A, Q?/p?) function in the resummation
exponent |!*| given that go(as) is already included up to O(a?) for NNLL’ accuracy. Only a modest
(negative) N°LL correction to the NNLL’ resummed cross section is found: between —(0.3 — 0.5)%.
We have verified that the NLP corrections are competitive with the numerical increase from NLL
to NNLL, and we show explicitly that they dominate over the increase from NNLL’ to N3LL
The scale uncertainty increases somewhat after including the NLP resummation. For the NNLL’
resummed result, the scale uncertainty is between —0.03% and +6.2%, whereas the NLP resummed
result shows a scale uncertainty between —2.9% and +8.3% (we expect that the inclusion NLP NLL
terms would reduce this scale uncertainty). Below, we report explicitly on the Higgs cross sections

'8One could also compare to the N°LL’ results, where one includes the O(a?) contribution to go(as). Here we
choose not to do so, in order to directly compare the numerical contribution of terms that are of O(a% In*~?(N))
with those that are of O(a* In(N)*/N) (where k runs from 1 to oo). If we would compare at LP N?LL’ instead, the
O(a* In*~*(N)) terms in the exponent would be multiplied by a different hard function than the LP NNLL’ + NLP
LL result, which pollutes the comparison with a possibly sizeable constant contribution.

We thus find a notable NLP LL contribution in the diagonal channel. Of course, the resummation
of the gg-channel is missing, which would also result in NLP LL enhanced terms (see fig. IS), and
may potentially alter the observed NLP effect. To estimate the size of such contributions we include
the NLP LL contribution from the qg-channel at N?LO, the order at which we expect the largest
contribution from a potential resummation in that channel. The full N3LO results for the Higgs
total cross section are available in the infinite-top-mass limit [63], and can be inferred from the
iHixs2 code (64). We find that the gg induced NLP LL contribution reads, in Mellin space,

an)" Cr(115C% + 500 4Cpr + 27C2,) In® N

T
which coincides with the prediction of ref. [16]. This gg-contribution results in a correction of the
NLP LL resummation effect of —0.5% (—3%) for small (large) @ values (see fig. [iiab. The O(a3)
contribution of the qg-channel thus gives a negligible contribution to the NLP Lbs. Adding the
terms of eq. does not lead to a noticeable reduction of the scale uncertainty (not shown in the
figure). Note that the smallness of the qg-initiated result is not caused by the partonic flux: the qg
flux exceeds the gg flux at w = 125 GeV. Instead, this contribution is relatively small because, in
contrast to the NLP LL contribution from the gg-channel, the gg-contribution is not proportional
to the sizable higher-order constant terms of the LP gg-channel contained in the O(a,) and O(a?)
contributions to the hard function go(a,). A similar hard function is not included for the qg-channel,
as cannot use an exponentiated form for the gg contribution, nor know what the hard function in
that case would be. We expect that the qg-channel will play a larger role in the DY process, where
the gj and gé coefficients are comparatively small.

4.2 DY invariant mass distribution

For the computation of the N-space resummed DY invariant mass distribution we use

SMH IN = PY Sod ful Ns) Fo(N 1) AGRP(N, 12), (54)
q

with oP given in eq. (15), ARP (N, Q?/17) in eq. (49) and the sum runs over quarks treated as

massless, q € {u,d,c,s,b}. We show the resulting ratio plots in fig. where as in the Higgs case,

all resummed results are matched to the NNLO result.

The LP NNLL’ + NLP LL resummation enhances the LO distribution (using w = Q) by 15 —
34%, with increasing effect for larger Q values. The NLP contribution provides an increase with
respect to the LP NNLL’ resummed (and matched) distribution of only 0.35 — 1.15%. Larger NLP
enhancements are found for very small values of Q, where one moves further away from threshold.
As for the Higgs production case, the NLP increase dominates over the N°LL effect, which is
—(0.1—0.3)% as shown in fig. where the larger deviation is only found for small values of Q (as
best seen in fig. [11b). The larger size of the NLP LL with respect to the N3LL is not as pronounced
as in the Higgs production case.

the orange solid (red dash-dotted) lines. The NNLL' NLP LL result obtained by adding the N?LO
NLP LL qg result is shown by the dotted light-blue line.

The scale uncertainty of the NNLL’ resummed result lies between —4.4% and +5.4% for the
range of Q values shown in fig. while that of the NLP resummed result is between —4.8% and
+5.8%. Therefore, by including the NLP LL contribution, we find a modest increase in the scale
uncertainty of the resummed result, which would expect to decrease if NLL resummation at NLP
were available. Note that for large Q values (Q > 1 TeV), the central value of the NLP correction
lies outside the LP resummed uncertainty band.

As in the Higgs production case, the NLP LL resummation is not complete, since the gg-channel
is missing (see fig. (9). Using the results of ref. [16], we may obtain the N?LO NLP LL contribution
stemming from the qg-channel, resulting in

as\3_ 27C% + 50C4Cr + 115C2. In® N
Apyqales(N) = — (2) Te—4 fa. (55)

As already anticipated, in contrast to what was observed for single Higgs production, we see that
the addition of this result to the resummed qg-channel significantly alters the NLP effect (fig.|11b).
The qg-contribution gives a —54% correction to the NLP effect of the dominant channel for small
Q values, while for larger Q values it gives a —44% correction. As for Higgs production, we find
that the scale uncertainties do not decrease after adding the gg NLP LL contribution at O(a).
This is perhaps not surprising: for both the Higgs and DY processes we introduce additional scale-
dependence via @, in either the NLP LL function AD for the leading channel, or via eq. (54) /
for the off-diagonal channel. This scale dependence is not balanced at LL, but could (for both
channels) be balanced at NLP NLL via the introduction a scale term proportional to In(Q?/7).
However, since we have no control over any other contribution that might appear at NLP NLL, we
refrain from adding this contribution.

4.3. Other colour-singlet production processes

To see how general our results for the impact of NLP effects are we extend the analysis to the
di-Higgs and di-boson production processes. As it is not our aim to provide a precise phenomeno-
logical prediction, but rather analyse the numerical effects of NLP LL resummation, we consider
the (unmatched) resummation of these processes up to LP NLL + NLP LL, and include only the
leading-order contribution to go(as).

We start by considering the di-Higgs production process, which is also dominated by gluon
fusion. Threshold resummation has been achieved first up to NLL in the SCET framework in
the heavy-top-mass limit, including top-quark-mass dependent form factors to partially correct for
this approximation. This study has been extended to NNLL in ref. [66], and the inclusion of
the full top-mass effects was studied up to NLL+NLO in ref. (67). Using full top-mass dependence,

which we study here, the lowest-order expression for the hadronic differential distribution Sgt

The bottom pannel shows the ratio with respect to the LO distribution.

while the integration limits are obtained by setting cos @ = +1. The exact expressions of ref. |68] are
used for Ca, Co, Fa, Fo and Gg, where no approximation on the mass ratio between the top-quark
and the Higgs boson has been applied.

For the resummation a this process, it suffices to follow the same procedure as before. That is, we
Mellin transform eq. with respect to the hadronic threshold variable 7. Then we replace the
partonic LO oetheone a ee ) by its resummed version, Cg9-nn(Q2) Ager? (N ,Q?/p? ). This
replacement is valid at LP (see ref. [69}). We exploit the universal structure of next-to-soft gluon
emissions to justify the same substitution at NLP. The resummed expression then reads

AO pp 2 _
IQ = Fg9-rhn(Q = els Oni TN fa(N, we) Fo(N, WAGE? (N, Q?/p?) . (59)

Since we work at NLL accuracy, we use the expression of eq. for AGQCP (N OF} i) with
go(as) = 1 and neglect the g®) contribution in the exponent.

The results are shown in fig. where we used a factorisation/renormalisation scale uw = Q/2,
which is the scale for which higher-order corrections are smallest [70]. We see that the LP NLL
result gives a correction to the LO distribution of —3.2% to 4.7%, while the NLP LL terms cancel
the partially negative LP correction, leading to a substantial enhancement of the LO distribution
of 12.6 — 17.8%. Larger corrections are found for higher values of Q. An increase of the NLP LL
+ LP NLL result with respect to the LP NLL result is found to be between 12.5% and 16.3%. As
for the DY and single Higgs processes, we thus again find that the NLP LL effect is sizeable. For
comparison, the increase of going from LP LL to LP NLL (not shown here) is of the same order [4]

We now move on to WtW~ and ZZ production. Threshold resummation up to NNLL was
considered in the direct-QCD framework in ref. (71), and for the SCET framework in ref. (72\73}.

“Note that the numerical size of the LP NLL contribution primarily comes from the term proportional to In(Q?/1:7)

Transverse-momentum resummation for both processes has also been performed in ref. . We use

the LO expressions from ref. (75]|76| Fy Ho] We may write, similarly to eq. (56)

The aE enn for the coefficients ci’, c#, and c#*, and the functions F;, J; and K; may be found in
ref. (75). Note that the partonic coefficient fmetions Oqqu—>Vv depend on the left- and right-handed
vous of the quarks with the Z-boson, which are of course different for up-type quarks and
down-type quarks. Following the same procedure as for the di-Higgs results, we obtain a resummed
expression for both cases that reads

dopp3vV+X Q) 2 fr “Nf

iq.= Oqqvv(Q = MW) Fa(N, 1) Mag (N, Q?/u7) - (64)

Note that in ref. [75], there is a misprint in the LO integrated coefficients (eq. (3.12)). The second terms in the
expressions for F;(s) and J;(s) need to be multiplied by a factor of 16.

27


The results are shown in fig. The two processes are identical from a resummation point-of-
view, therefore, we find an LP NLL increase of the LO distribution between 12.2 — 20.8% for both
processes, whereas the NLP LL + LP NLL increases the LO distribution by 19.2 — 26.2%. As for
the other processes, larger enhancements are found for higher values of Q.

The increase induced by the NLP LL contributions with respect to the LP NLL result is between
4.5 — 6.8%, which is smaller than the correction that was found for the di-Higgs process. This is not
surprising: it is well known that gluon-initiated processes receive larger LL threshold corrections
due to C4 > Cpr. The difference between LP LL and LP NLL resummation for the VV processes
is around 1%, which is not dissimilar from the increase found for the inclusion of the NLP terms.
We therefore again see the numerical importance of the NLP LL terms.

What we have observed for all processes is that the NLP LL contribution is not negligible, and
in many cases exceeds the size of higher-logarithmic LP contributions. To understand this, note
that the saddle-point approximation for the inverse Mellin transform integral leads to values of N
around 1.5 — 3 (38\[39){77)(78}. With a, ~ 0.12, we have a, In(N) ~ a, In(N)/N, while the NNLL
term a? In(N) is suppressed by as. Naturally, we do not suggest to cease pursuing effects of higher-
logarithmic LP contributions. Firstly, one can include the O(a;) contribution in the hard function
go(a@s) (i.e. leading to LP NLL’) accuracy), resulting in a large correction if the constant contribution
of the NLO correction is sizeable, as we have seen for single Higgs production, and also seems to be
the case for di-Higgs production (see e.g. (67||79|/80}). Secondly, although the central result might
change minimally by including higher-logarithmic contributions at LP, such contributions stabilize
the scale dependence of the prediction.

4.4 Some final remarks on NLP LL resummation in dQCD

In this section we have explored the numerical behaviour of the NLP ne correction (eq. (49)) on
a few selected colour-singlet production processes. For all processes we reach a similar conclusion:
the inclusion of NLP LL resummation leads to a numerically noticeable result. We briefly comment
on the relation between the work on NLP resummation presented here and in refs. for single
Higgs production. The methods employed in this paper may best be compared to their ~# — softa
prescription without exponentiation of the constant contributions The ~ — softg prescription
consists of replacing A in the resummation exponents g®(d) by the combination of polygamma
functions A = asbo(2y0(N) — 3u0(N + 1) + 2v0(N + 2)). Denoting their resummation exponent at
LP NLL with Py the difference with our LP NLL + NLP LL resummation exponent (eq.

without gf and with go(as) = 1) may be evaluated at O(a;), where we obtain

y—softe _ ~dQCD A} 4(1) fond _ Aa’, Q

AD 1 95 25. Q@ 1

The difference at LP is of NNLL accuracy, and originates from using N exponentation in the
w — soft, prescription rather then N exponentiation, which is what we have used in our work. At
NLP, the difference is of NLL accuracy, whereas the discrepancy at NNLP starts at LL with the

of the perturbative expansion. Numerical differences between A — softz and w — softz are shown to be small there.

28


term proportional to In(N)/N?. They observe that the correction on the fixed-order single Higgs
production cross section is increased with respect to standard resummation by making the w — soft
replacement, consistent with our observations on the effect of NLP LL resummation. No soft-quark
correction was considered in their work. To the best of our knowledge, a similar analysis at the
hadronic level for DY has not been performed.

Returning to our results, we found in this section that for single Higgs-production the central
value of the LP NNLL’ + NLP LL resummed coefficient lies outside the uncertainty band for the
LP resummed (and matched) result. For DY production processes this is observed for Q > 1 TeV.
Both processes show that the numerical effect of resumming the NLP LL terms exceeds that of
improving LP resummation to N°LL accuracy. Scale uncertainties seem to slightly increase after
the NLP LL result is included. We expect that the scale uncertainty can be reduced only after
the inclusion of the (unavailable) NLP NLL contributions. For di-boson production the numerical
enhancement of upgrading a LP LL calculation to NLP LL rivals (in the case of di-Higgs) or exceeds
(for W*W-/ZZ) that of going from LP LL to LP NLL, for central scale choices. In general,
NLP LL effects originating from next-to-soft-gluon emissions are found to be larger for gg-induced
processes than for gqg-induced processes. On the other hand, we find that the off-diagonal qg NLP
LL contribution is more important for the gq-induced DY process than for the gg-induced Higgs
process.

5 Comparison of NLP resummation in SCET and dQCD

NLP corrections have been calculated and resummed not only in direct QCD, as described in
section but also within soft-collinear effective field theory (SCET). While the two approaches
should formally give the same result, numerical differences have turned out to be sizable for LP
resummation, and originate from power-suppressed contributions that are included differently in
the two methods [39]|81]||84}{87]. Now that the exact LL NLP contribution (in z-space) has been
determined in both approaches, it is important to perform such a comparison again, and we do so
in this section. We shall see that the inclusion of the LL NLP contribution reduces the numerical
differences between the two approaches. For the comparison we consider Drell-Yan and Higgs
production, at LP NNLL (i.e. we use eq. (27) with go up to O(as) for (QCD) and NLP LL accuracy.
We refrain from matching to fixed-order calculations as this has no bearing on the comparison of
resummed calculations.

Below we first establish notation for SCET resummation, and briefly discuss the results of
(19}21], revisiting in particular the so-called kinematic correction. We obtain a slightly modified
SCET resummation formula, which will ease our task of relating the SCET formalism to (QCD. We
then proceed to the comparison of the NLP LL contributions within the two theories. Note that while
presenting the analytical comparisons, we use the 6-function coefficients b, and By, = (47)"*1b,
(eq. and (149)) interchangeably, as the b,, are often used in dQCD, whereas £,, are usually

preferred in SCET. The section is concluded by discussing numerical results for both methods.

5.1 NLP Resummation in SCET
Using the results of ref. , we write the analogue of eq. in SCET up to NLP in z-space as

A®CET (2) _ ASCET,LP (z) ts ASCET,NLP (z), (66)

29


where ASCET.LP/NLP (z) resums large logarithms at LP and NLP, respectively, and the scale depen-
dence of these factors is suppressed. The NLP term ASCFT-NLP(z) consists of two contributions: a
kinematic factor, which originates from taking the partonic cross section to LP in the SCET oper-
ator product expansion, but retaining the exact kinematics up to NLP, and a dynamical correction
that arises by considering sub-leading-power operators

ASCETNLP (7) _ ASRETNEP (7) + AsceeNt? (2). (67)

We first focus on the kinematic correction, which together with its LP counterpart, is expressed in

the factorised form

ADY,SCET,LP+NLP Q _1/a ae) DY(Q. #
for the DY partonic coefficient function of the qqg-channel, and
1/a\*? a
Ah SCET,LP+NLP() py Q 14 h(Q, z

for the gg-channel contribution to Higgs production, (21). The hard function H depends on short-
distance physics, and is different for DY and Higgs. The function Sp denotes the Fourier transform
of the position-space soft function

O | <.o~

where the latter is defined as a vacuum-expectation value of time-ordered products of Wilson lines

associated to the directions of the external partons

S(x) = 2 HOEY (oY (o)] T[Y7(0)¥,(0)]|0). (71)

Here C = N, for Drell Yan, and C = N? — 1 for Higgs production. Furthermore, the soft Wilson
lines are defined in terms of soft gluon fields in SCET

¥i(e) =Pexp i. / . dem Aslar + arex)|| (72)

where the light-like vectors nz are oriented along the directions of the incoming partons. At NLO
the Drell-Yan and Higgs soft functions are related by the simple replacement Cr — Cy. The
normalizations for the Higgs and DY case are chosen, as explained in section [2|and further discussed
in appendix |B} such that we have a universal NLP LL correction for both processes, resulting in
a 1/z difference between the Higgs and DY factorisation formulae, as it is evident by comparing
eq. (68) with eq. (69). The variable , is the reciprocal energy, and is given by Q,. = 2\/s(1— \/z).

Eqs. and (69) are expanded in powers of 1 — z, which implies in particular that Q, is
expanded around 2 = Q(1 — z). Then, the LP contribution reads

ADY/b,SCET,LP (») _ H(Q7)QSo (OQ, Z) ; iY)

z=0

30


where we have suppressed the DY/h labels of H and So. At fixed-order, both H and Sp depend
on the factorisation scale. The hard function contains factors of In(Q?/p?), and the soft function
contains In(Q?(1 — z)?/?). Therefore, depending on the choice of jz, either H or So will result in
a large logarithmic correction. However, the hard and soft functions obey renormalisation-group
equations (RGEs). According to the effective-field theory approach, it is then possible to choose
a natural scale, wp, ~ Q for the hard function, and yp, ~ Q(1 — z) for the soft function, such that
fixed-order logarithms are small. The original large logarithms are then resummed using the RGEs
to evolve the hard and soft function from their natural scale to the scale at which the cross section
is evaluated. We will recall the resummed partonic cross section one obtains starting from eq.
in what follows, but let us first revisit the NLP terms originating from the expansion eqs. (68)
and (69), i.e. the kinematic correction.

To obtain eq. (73), we made the choice to expand eq. and eq. around 2, = Q and set
s = Q?. At NLP, this choice leads to the kinematic NLP corrections Ky,...,K4

The Ky term comes from identifying aoe = ah + O(1 — z), and Ko originates from the Taylor
expansion of the soft function around 2, = Q. The K3 term is the first order of the expansion
of Q/z in the case of DY, and Q/z? in the case Higgs, hence the resulting contribution Sx, is
different for these processes. Finally, K'4 contains the Taylor expansion of the hard function around

s = Q?/z. Evaluating these terms up to NLP yields for their sum [|

sPY(n) = 2%sCr qa), (76a)
sha) = p%sCa | 2nk +1] 9). (76b)

With these definitions, the LP partonic cross section with full kinematic dependence is expanded as

DY/h,SCET,LP+NLP,_\ _ , DY/h,SCET,LP DY /h,SCET,NLP
where AP (z) is strictly LP, as defined in eq. (73), and the corresponding NLP kinematic correction
is given eq. (74). While this choice is consistent with a systematic power expansion, it is also
possible to consider other expansion schemes, for which parts of the kinematic correction are not

expanded, but instead kept within the LP term. Here we discuss one such case, motivated by the
comparison with dQCD resummation. In this expansion scheme we keep factors of Q/,/z exact,
i.e. we expand 9* around Q = S(1 — z). Comparing with eq. (28), we immediately see that this
choice consistently keeps the same kinematic factor in the exponent, both in the (QCD and in the
SCET approach. The LP factorisation then reads

ADY/bSCET.LP(.) — 1(Q *) 8 (0, z)

This choice leads for the Ky and Ky contributions of the kinematic correction (eq. (74)) ) toa
replacement of 2 —> Q. The kinematic corrections K2 and K3 change and become

This expansion scheme presents several advantages. First of all, the constant (NLP NLL) contri-

bution, which was originally present in APY! nSCETNLP(), is now absent in the new kinematic

correction ApY!™ aia ALE (g), At the same time, the NLP LL contribution, which is absent for the
DY case, and equal to the scale logarithm in the Higgs case, is unchanged. Explicitly, we have

§PY(Q) = 0, (80a)
as Cay, & 0(9). (80b)

Sha) = —-4

The NLP NLL contribution that was present in eq. is now removed by the new expansion
scheme. This contribution represents a phase space correction, which is universal. Instead of
residing in the kinematic correction, it is now contained in the modified LP term of eq. (78); in this
way it too can be readily resummed.

With this result in mind, we move to the resummed SCET LP expression, obtained by evolving
the hard and soft function to an equal scale. If we use the LP factorisation as in eq. one obtains

Yan and Higgs production in appendix |D} up to NLO, which is sufficient to achieve resummation at

NNLLE accuracy. The corresponding expression up to NNLO, necessary to achieve resummation at

N°LL can be found in and [34], respectively [| In eqs. and (82) the actual resummation

In appendix [D] we provide the explicit expansion in a of both $,(Q?, u2) and a,,(u?,v*), as well
as the anomalous dimensions they depend upon. Note that the functions Ag(as) (from dQCD) and
Tcusp,a(@s) coincide up to O(a?)

Dass, Ot.) = Aag(as), (88)

as can be seen by comparing the equations in appendix [D}

Comparing eq. with eq. we see that the difference between the two schemes amounts to
a factor of z~"*, which resums NLP NLL contribution of kinematic origin. The resummation formula
defined in eq. coincides with the one found in (84|/89]. What is new from our discussion above,
is the fact that the NLP LL resummed contribution can be added consistently to both eq. (81), as
was done in (19]/21], or to eq. (82), as we are doing here. The latter is particularly useful for the
comparison with dQCD. The ultimate reason that allows one to proceed in this way is the fact that
the NLP LL contribution to the kinematic soft function is unaltered by the different convention that
leads from eq. to eq. (80), which affects only NLLs at NLP. Thus, the LL contribution from the
NLP kinematic soft function is added unaltered to the LL contribution from the NLP dynamical
soft function, according to eq. (67), preserving the universality of the total NLP LL contribution,
whose resummed expression takes the form

2Ca , as(u?)
ASCET,NLP l 41 2 ,,2\ __ . 2,2
( mo "Os(pe) [S .LL(Q »>M ) fe} LL(US, )] ’ (89)

Concerning Higgs production, note that we directly integrate out the top quark, and do not include a separate
coefficient Cy(m:) with its corresponding evolution factor, as for instance in |84]. The reason is that here we are
interested in comparing the SCET result with dQCD, where the factor C;(mz) is included in the function go. Thus
we include the fixed order C;(m:) into Hn(Q, un), where at NLO it contributes a factor 11/6.

Interestingly, we can directly obtain the NLP LL SCET contribution from the LP LL one. The LP
LL SCET contribution is obtained after setting z~"* = 1, §& = 1 and H(Q,up,) = 1. Furthermore
a, = 0 at NLL, such that the evolution exponent eq. simply becomes

Uaa,LL(Q, Hs) = exp [Sati(Q”, #2)] = exp [Sani (Q?, uw?) — Sati(H3, u”)) - (91)

The NLP contribution can then be obtained from this evolution exponent via a derivative

By now evaluating 8 (as (12) to its lowest order and recognizing that AW = C4, we readily find
that this result is equal to eq. (89). It is remarkable that we could perform a similar derivative trick
in dQCD (eq. (45) to obtain the LL NLP results. There the derivative is taken with respect to N,
while here it is taken with respect to the coupling evaluated at the soft scale. We will see in what
follows that these forms are actually equal.

5.2 Analytical comparison of (QCD and SCET at NLP

We are now in a position to relate resummation in (QCD vs SCET, where we closely follow ref.
(81}|85), where this was performed at LP, up to NNLL. We keep the same LP logarithmic accuracy,
but we extend their analysis to NLP LL (in N-space). To compare resummation in dQCD vs SCET,
it is convenient to convert the SCET resummation formula to Mellin space. We set the hard and
factorisation scale (j1;, and j4) equal to Q, and to obtain a function whose Mellin transform may be
performed analytically, we assume that the soft scale jz, is independent of z [86]. Furthermore, we
will work with the expansion scheme in eq. (82), and comment on the role of z~™ at the end of this

section. Then we can write [9]

a 2 T(N — nq)e7 212"
ASCETLP(N. Q.4,) = H .) Be in & ; E

Up to NNLL accuracy we may use
~ Os (12) ° Q?
fq = 1+ Cy (ce) + In? ‘2 + 2In iF On, + OF, ) (94)

Furthermore, the ratio of I'-functions in eq. (93) may be expanded in the large-N limit, resulting in
[T(N 7 Te *1EM —2na In N Na 1
= a 14+—+0|-—,]]. 95
T(N + na) . ty to ye ie

Note that this is only formally true when 7a > 0, otherwise we have to regulate eq. (82) by using a +-description
for the term involving (1 — z)~'*?"*. The results remain unchanged in this procedure 8).

34


By using eq. and eq. in eq. (93), we obtain

For the NLP SCET result in Mellin space we use eq. and take yw, again independent of z, which
results in

We now compare eq. (97) and eq. (98) to A?QCP as defined in eq. 23) with ELPINEP in eq, (46)

it is contained by the ratio of [-functions (eq. (95)). To see this, we set 4; = Q/N, as motivated

by ref. [39]|86}. We then find that

With a = ye In(1 — 2A) at the first non-trivial order, we indeed observe that this factor gives rise

where the first factor is contained in U(Q, us = Q/N), while the second one is generated by the

ratio of [-functions (eq. (95).
We can also relate DZP*N"P (which is equal to DEP up to NLP NNLL accuracy) to its SCET

counterpart. From eq. (84), we see that this must be contained in —ay,(Q?, 2) + 2a,, (2, Q?). We

of eq. (114), such that up to NNLL and for ps. = Q/N we have

which is of NLP), we obtain

Note that Dr gives an additional factor of ¢(2) at NNLL (see also eq. (43)), turning the 3¢(2)
discrepancy into a —¢(2) difference between the wide-angle contribution Daq for dQCD, and the
sum of anomalous dimensions for SCET. We will see that this remaining (last) term is resolved after
including the hard function of SCET and dQCD.

In eq. (118), we have achieved part of the LP result of eq. (97). What remains is to relate
the hard function of dQCD, go(as), to the product H(Q,Q) §a(0,Q/N) in SCET (where we set
Ls = Q/N, such that the second line of eq. (97) is 0). This comparison may be done easily. For DY
we have (see eq. (157) of appendix [D)

HI(Q,Q)8K(0,Q/8) = (1404! (e vce) om fa.cF AG] + (08). (122)

Note that in the SCET hard functions of eq. (120) and ( = there is an additional exponent with
respect to the dQCD hard functions of eq. i and nen ca. contributions precisely cancel
the last term in eq. (11g). By now combining these ny in eq. , we find

By comparing this result to the dQCD result of eq. with h“ set to zero, we see that the
difference between dQCD and SCET at LP consists of the O(7_/N)-term. This term is included

38


in the LP SCET result, but absent in the LP dQCD result. Therefore, we see that the difference
between dQCD and SCET starts at NLP in Mellin space, as was noted before in ref. (39}(81|[85}.

We now study how the NLP LL contribution modifies this result. First we see that 7q (eq. (83))
at the first logarithmic order is given by

AW as(Q?)_ Aa?
Na = ln 2 2 =
Tho = a's (Q?/ N72) tbo

In(1 — 2). (124)

Moreover, we set Saii(Q?/N?,Q?) = —29() using eq. (90). With this, we find that the NLP
SCET result of eq. can be written in Mellin space as

(125)

' 2 2Al)) In(1 — 2A)
SCET,NLP (1) @
A (N,Q,Q/N) = exp [=o | [: aio W ,

where we have used the result of eq. (90). Adding this to the LP result restricted to LL (where

H =5 =1, and a, = 0), we find
2 (1) (A) 1 AW In(1 _ 2X) (126)
an? tbo N :

ASCET,LP+NLP,LL (N, Q, Q/N) = exp

The NLP correction in the second factor is precisely the first-order expansion of the NLP exponent
no (d) of dQCD. Hence, at NLP LL, the contributions from SCET and dQCD are the same if one
sets tis = Q/N. Differences between the two formalisms originate from i) truncations of higher-
logarithmic terms, ii) truncations on higher-power terms (i.e. a factor of 1/N? is included in dQCD
once the NLP exponent is expanded up to O(a2) or beyond, while it is missing in the SCET
formalism), and iii) running-a, effects.

We recall that we can obtain the NLP z-space contribution by deriving the LP LL result towards
As(f4s) (eq. (92)). We now comment on how this compares to the dQCD result, where the NLP
N-space result can be obtained via a derivative of the LP LL term towards N. The N-space form

of eq. is

ASCSL,NLE/

1 a)
~ Blass) Be, Gay Vaatt(@:Hs) ) (127)

as these functions do not depend on z. Using the definition of the 6-function and setting 1, = Q/N,
the this equation can be rewritten as

zy Q, Ls, a)

° Usa1u(Q,Q/N). (128)

1
ASCET.NEP (z, Q, Ls, 7) = D) ON

Since we have established that Uaaii(Q, Q/N) = exp [2-9%)] , we find that eq. is equal to

the derivative trick in dQCD (eq. (44) at the first-order expansion of the exponent.

We have now established that the contributions from SCET and dQCD are the same at NLP
LL accuracy if one sets 4s = Q/N. Two important remarks are in order. Firstly, for our SCET
starting point we have included a factor of z~" in eq. (82). If we would not include this factor as
in eq. (81), the ratio of T-functions in eq. would instead be

Figure 15: Ratio plots for the NNLL results for DY (left) and Higgs (right) with respect to the
dQCD distributions. The SCET LP result at NNLL (dark-blue dashed line) is divided by the
dQCD result at LP NNLL. The SCET NLP results indicated by the light-blue lines are obtained

via eq. (130) (dashed), eq. (dash-dotted) and eq. (dotted), and divided by the dQCD result
at LP NNLL + NLP LL.

The factor of 7? is removed by including z~", which has a phase-space origin. In dQCD, we
recognize this factor in the Jj contribution in eq. (32), which also has a phase-space origin: it
comes from the In(z) expansion around z = 1 as performed in eq. (31). This factor is needed in
dQCD to obtain the NLP contribution directly from performing a derivative on the LP contribution,
as shown in eq. (36). However, even without performing the derivative trick, we truncate the (QCD
NLP result at strictly NLP LL (resulting in the function nD), If one would omit the factor of z~"
in the SCET resummation formula, one would introduce an NLP NLL term via the factor of 772.
Therefore, by including this factor, the SCET and dQCD formalisms are put on equal grounds. We
shall see that the numerical impact of this factor is sizeable.

Secondly, although we have found analytical agreement at LP + NLP LL accuracy between
dQCD and SCET , we will see that there are numerical differences, which especially grow sizable
when the LP part is evaluated at NNLL. This is caused by the fact that in (QCD the NLP contri-
bution is multiplied by the hard coefficient go(as), whereas in SCET, the NLP LL result is added
to the LP result. Indeed, in ASCE™NP | we do not see a hard function, so for SCET the NLP
result will not get enhanced by constant contributions. This is simply the result of a choice, i.e. of
including strictly NLP LL logarithms in z-space in the SCET NLP resummation formula eq. (so).
As a remedy, we can upgrade the NLP SCET result for both DY and Higgs by using

APY/MSCET.NEP (2 Qy4,, 1) = 2Ca In as (p17)

5.3 Numerical comparison of (QCD and SCET resummation at NLP

Here we show the numerical results of the (QCD and SCET comparison. For the LP NNLL + NLP
LL dQCD results, we use expression eq. ov eq. (22), and we include go(a,) up to O(a;). The
SCET results are obtained by adding eq. (89) (the NLP result) to eq. (the LP result with the
factor of z~"+). We also show the results that are obtained excluding the factor of z~"* from eq. (82),
as in eq. (81), and those obtained by dressing the NLP SCET result by H(Q, un) (eq. (130)). The
results are shown in fig. Interestingly, we observe that near-perfect agreement is found between
dQCD and SCET at NLP LL accuracy if one includes both the hard function and z~". If both
these factors are included, we find that the difference between dQCD and SCET does not exceed

Al


O(0.5%) (O(1%)) for the Higgs (DY) case. This may be contrasted to the LP case, where the
differences are of O(25% — 12%) (O(10% — 4%)). Especially in the Higgs case, the inclusion of H
in the NLP SCET result is important, as without it, differences of O(10 — 20%) are found between
dQCD and SCET. The inclusion of z~"* in the LP result also plays a significant role. Without it,
the DY results differ between dQCD and SCET by O(15 — 5%), while for Higgs, differences up to
40% may be found for small values of the scale Q. The discrepancies decrease towards larger values
of Q.

In fig. [16] we examine how robust these results are under variation of the scale. We first examine
the case where we vary between w = 2Q and pp = Q/2 (top and middle panel). For the SCET
LP result, we again use eq. and for the NLP result, we use eq. (130). In general, the (QCD
uncertainty is larger than the SCET scale uncertainty. Note that the dQCD scale uncertainty band
does not contain the LP SCET central value for large values of Q. The situation is worse for the LP
SCET scale uncertainty, where especially for the Higgs production case the LP dQCD central value
is not contained in the uncertainty band. This changes at NLP. At NLP, the dQCD uncertainty
band does not change in size, but with the SCET result lying much closer to the dQCD result, it is
now contained inside the uncertainty band. For SCET, the uncertainty band does shrink at NLP,
which is especially pronounced for Higgs production.

In dQCD, one implicitly varies the ‘soft scale’ via the inverse Mellin transform. If we equate NV
to Q/js, as we have done above, we readily see that all values of N (and hence of the soft scale) are
accessible by integrating over N. In SCET one has to vary the soft scale explicitly, and we show the
effect of this in the bottom panel of fig. There, one may observe that the uncertainty obtained
by varying the soft scale grows very large (especially for the Higgs case) once the NLP corrections
are included. The soft-scale variation of the LP SCET result is small, and the LP dQCD result
is not contained in this uncertainty band, however, the LP dQCD is contained in the soft-scale
uncertainty band of the NLP SCET result.

In this section, we have compared the NLP LL SCET and dQCD contribution both analytically
and numerically. At the analytical level, differences between NLP LL SCET and dQCD start at
O(a?) and O(1/N?). However, we find that the numerical impact of these terms is small, as we
see near-perfect numerical agreement between dQCD and SCET for both the Higgs and DY cases.
However, this agreement can only be obtained if one includes the hard function in the NLP SCET
contribution at the same order as the LP SCET contribution, and if the factor of z~"* is included
in the LP SCET contribution. Without this latter factor, the difference between the NLP dQCD
and SCET result starts at O(n?2/N) = O(a2 In? N/N), which is an NLP NLL contribution. This
contribution turns out to be sizeable, as we have shown in fig.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we have studied the role and impact of NLP corrections in colour-singlet production
processes, with a particular focus on DY and single Higgs production. In section [2] we assessed
the quality of the threshold expansion for Higgs and DY, for both the dominant (qq and gg) and
the subdominant (qg) partonic channels. The threshold expansion of the dominant Higgs produc-
tion channel is less well-behaved than that of DY, due to a substantial part of the Higgs partonic
cross section arising from the small z region. The quality of the threshold expansion depends only
marginally on the boson mass @ for DY, while the convergence for Higgs noticeably improves as
Q increases. The threshold expansion of the off-diagonal qg-channel in Higgs production conver-

42


gences only very slowly, whereas for DY convergence is already obtained after including the N4LP
contribution.

We reviewed the resummation of leading-logarithmic NLP corrections in dQCD in section
and derived a slightly improved resummed expression involving a derivative with respect to the
Mellin moment (eq. (45)). This we applied to the NLP LL + LP NNLL’ DY and Higgs cross sec-
tions (as well as di-Higgs and di-vector boson production, albeit at lower logarithmic accuracy) and
performed numerical studies (section (4). For the DY /Higgs diagonal channels we found that the
NLP LL resummation has a notable numerical impact on the NNLL’ resummed result matched to
NNLO for both production processes, especially when compared to the effect of the N?LL contri-
bution. A similarly sizeable impact was seen in the di-boson processes. The off-diagonal gg NLP
LL contribution is more important for DY than for single-Higgs production given the large 6(1— z)
contributions in the latter process at NLO and NNLO, which enter the resummation formula via
the matching coefficient go and inflate the resummation effects in the Higgs diagonal channel.

In section |5} we performed an analytical and numerical comparison of the NLP LL resummed
expressions in the (QCD and SCET frameworks. A derivative construction to obtain the NLP
LL contribution, similar to the Mellin derivative in (QCD, can be employed in SCET (eq. (92)),
where the derivative is performed in the coupling evaluated at the SCET soft scale w,. At NLP
we found from our analytical analysis that differences between the two formalisms originate from
truncations of higher-logarithmic or higher-power terms, and running-a, effects. These differences
resulted in very small numerical discrepancies once the NLP corrections were included; the two
formalisms then agree numerically to O(0.5%)/O(1%) for Higgs/DY production after setting hard
scales equal to Q, and the SCET soft scale equal to Q/N. To obtain this agreement, we argued that
a factor of z~" is profitably included in the LP SCET expression, which originates from treating
the kinematics of the scattering exact up to NLP. Indeed, sizeable numerical differences between
the dQCD and SCET results of O(5 — 15%) in the DY case and O(15 — 40%) in the Higgs case are
found if this factor is not included. Furthermore, we showed that the hard function of SCET that
multiplies the NLP resummation should contain O(a.) corrections as well, certainly for the Higgs
case. Large numerical differences are found for the Higgs case without including this factor, where
the 6(1 — z)-contribution, and hence the hard function itself, is large. For the DY case the need is
somewhat less compelling, as its 6(1 — z)-contribution is smaller.

As part of our SCET-dQCD comparison we examined the factorisation/renormalisation-scale
variation of the SCET and dQCD results, varying between Q/2 and 2Q, and the SCET soft scale
tts between Q/(2/N) and 2Q/N. At LP, the dQCD and SCET central-value results do not lie
in each other’s scale-uncertainty bands. Conversely, at NLP, the central-value results show only a
small numerical discrepancy and comfortably lie within each other’s scale-uncertainty bands. The
uncertainty bands do increase upon including NLP effects for both dQCD (by varying 4) and SCET
(by varying js). We expect this to be reversed once NLP NLL contributions would be included.

Our study of the numerical effects of NLP corrections in hadronic collisions is, we believe, a
valuable addition to an area where most effort has so far been on the analytical side. It moreover
validates these efforts by showing that NLP threshold corrections can have a notable impact, and
should motivate further development of the understanding of NLP corrections.

A Fitted parton distribution functions

In this paper we rely on PDF's obtained from the LHAPDF library and use the central member
of the PDF4LHC15_ NNLO_ 100 PDF set (54). For our purposes these PDF's need to be converted
to N-space to perform the resummation. To this end, we expand the PDFs on a basis of polynomials

whose Mellin transforms may be computed directly. The functional form of the PDF's that we use
is inspired by that used by the MMHT collaboration, and reads

af (x) = A(1 — 2)“ 2% (1 + by + c(2y? — 1)) + BIL — 2) 2%(1 + Cx®) for y=1-—2/z, (131)

with 10 (real) fit parameters. We require that the fitted function lies within the lo error as given
by the LHAPDF grid implementation of the PDFs in the entire domain. We have checked our
set by comparing the fixed-order results obtained with the x-space form of the fitted PDFs with
those obtained using the grid directly, and found that differences are smaller than the numerical
integration error. A tabulated form in c++ format of the resulting fit parameters is available at (92).

B- Normalization of the partonic cross section

In this appendix we discuss the normalization of the partonic cross section A;;(z), with the particular
aim to highlight the origin of the additional factor of 1/z appearing in Higgs production relative to
DY. We start from the definition of the invariant mass distribution for DY, which according to the
QCD factorisation theorem is given as

B
= = X | aoa fa/A(®a) fos B (Xo) én( =) (132)
where Gq5(Q?/(xarpS)) is the partonic cross section, and we drop the renormalisation /factorisation
scale dependence for conciseness. For Higgs production an analogous equation holds, with the
invariant mass distribution replaced by the total cross section.
We first rewrite the partonic cross section in terms of z = Q?/(xarpS) = Q?/s. This can be
done by inserting

1 - 1 Le
I= i dz6 (: — ) = | dz @aXp 0 (T — LaXpz) = | dz —6(T — La%p2Z), (133)
0 LaXb 0 0 z

44


where we recall that 7 = Q?/S. With this, eq. (132) becomes

do

dq? » / dz dradxp fa/a(Xa) fo/B (xo) 6 (7 — Laz) ~ Gab(2) ; (134)

This equation is then matched to eq. (14), which we repeat here

ne = o0(Q?) S- / dzdxadzp fa/a(Xa) fosp (2b) 6 (T — LaXz) Aao(z). (135)
a,b

The matching equation

- Car(z) = o9(Q”) Aav(2); (136)

is defined such that o9(Q”) contains the terms of the tree-level cross section which are z-independent,
while A,,(z) contains the z-dependent terms.

We are now in a position to perform the matching in eq. for the DY and Higgs tree-level
cross section. We start from the matrix element squared for the two processes, summed (averaged)
over the final (initial) state partons

N21)

The factor of s* in the Higgs matrix element squared is due to the derivative squared contained in

the Gi, G°"’H term of the effective Lagrangian. Given the one-particle phase space with the flux
factor of 1/2s

1
55081 = [a 20 5) (p, + po — q)d* (q? — Q?) = Sol — 2), (138)

the partonic cross section for the two processes reads

(0 Atrat,, 1 2 (0 a 1
a= Sor yg a) = wBeayeaqll 2), (139)

We see that the DY cross section has an additional factor of z compared to Higgs production,
whose origin is ultimately related to the dimensionful effective ggH vertex versus the elementary
qqy vertex. The coefficient AM (2) is now obtained from eq. (136), where ob and op are taken as
in eqs. and (15), which implies

1
AW aq = 5(1 - 2); AM = =6(L—2). (140)

At tree level the additional factor of 1/z is of course harmless, given the overall 6(1 — z). However,
this factor is general, and it is present also at higher orders in perturbation theory, explaining the

origin of the factor 1/z in eq. (9) (see also eq. (13).

C Singular contributions at threshold (LP)

In order to asses how the parton flux weighs the partonic cross section, it is useful to consider
the point-by-point multiplication of the partonic cross section and the parton luminosity factor
Lij(7/z)/z. For non-singular terms beyond LP this is trivial, but the singular contributions at LP
consist of plus-distributions which have the non-local definition

1 1
i dz [g(z)], F(z) =| dz g(z) (f(z) — FM) - (141)
0 0

In this appendix we show explicitly how one obtains an equivalent point-by-point multiplication for
the LP terms. Starting from the hadronic cross section

pais -[ de Lis(T/z) dé. (z a) (142)

z dz

we express the partonic cross section, differential in z, as

z) 0 ft, ,dé(z’)

dz

The boundary term in the first line vanishes at z = 1 by a vanishing domain for the integral over 2’,
as well as at the lower boundary since lim,_,, £;;(7/z) = 0. The plus-distributions in the remaining
term on the first line of eq. are now separately integrated, with the trivial test function
f(z’) =1, such that we may use

[toe = [aoe [etae. (145)

to obtain the second line of eq. (144). The integrand of eq. (144) has a point-by-point multiplica-
tion form, consisting of the integrated plus-distributions weighted by the derivative of the parton

Upon integration by parts we find
