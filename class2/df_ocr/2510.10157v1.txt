Abstract

Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of
large language models by simulating human
collective intelligence but suffer from signif-
icant drawbacks, such as high computational
costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng per-
sona vectors for Large Language model cre-
ativitY), a training-free framework that cap-
tures the benefits of multi-LLM collaboration,
i.e., inducing diverse perspectives and special-
ized expertise, within a single model. BILLY
operates by extracting and blending multiple
distinct persona vectors directly in the model’s
activation space. We steer the model’s genera-
tion process with this merged vector while infer-
ence, enabling multi-perspective output with-
out explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented bench-
marks demonstrate that BILLY surpasses single
model prompting and traditional multi-LLM
approaches, while substantially reducing infer-
ence time and computational costs. Our analy-
ses further reveal that distinct persona vectors
can be blended to achieve both effective control
over complementary aspects of generation and
greater interpretability.

1 Introduction

Creativity is widely recognized as a cornerstone of
human progress, driving innovation across domains
and enabling major scientific breakthroughs (Feist,
1998; Simonton, 2004). Extending this perspec-
tive, recent research (Franceschelli and Musolesi,
2023; Lin et al., 2025) has explored the creativity
of large language models (LLMs), viewing them as
promising tools for applications such as story writ-
ing (G6mez-Rodriguez and Williams, 2023; Chen
et al., 2024b), design ideation (Ding et al., 2023;
Hou et al., 2024; Hung et al., 2025), and scien-
tific discovery (Yang et al., 2024b; Si et al., 2025),
thereby augmenting human problem-solving and
imagination (Zhang et al., 2023; Lim and Perrault,

ity of a single LLM, we extract and fuse the per-
sona vectors of a Creative Professional and an
Environmentalist, steering a base model by this com-
posite vector to generate outputs based on both domains.

2024; Liu et al., 2024, 2025).

Recent studies highlight the potential of the
multi-LLM paradigm (Guo et al., 2024; Lu et al.,
2024; Lin et al., 2025), which aims to simulate hu-
man collective intelligence (Leimeister, 2010) by
engaging multiple LLMs in iterative discussion to
arrive at more comprehensive and well-balanced
solutions (Tran et al., 2025). This paradigm allows
systems to generate a broader range of ideas be-
yond a single model can reach (Tran et al., 2025).
In the context of creativity, these frameworks often
assign diverse roles to LLMs and employ struc-
tured, multi-round interactions (Lu et al., 2024; Lin
et al., 2025; Su et al., 2025; Liang et al., 2024).

Our method, BILLY, takes its name from The Minds of
Billy Milligan by Daniel Keyes—but the emoji in the title @
nods to “Billie” Eilish instead.


For example, one LLM may act as a creative profes-
sional while another serves as an environmentalist,
enabling the system to explore and integrate multi-
ple perspectives. Through such iterative exchanges,
the models collaboratively converge on creative so-
lutions that balance innovation with sustainability.

Despite these advantages, multi-LLM frame-
works also face a major challenge: the substantial
computational cost and increased inference time as-
sociated with multi-LLM coordination (Tran et al.,
2025). The iterative nature of multi-LLM dialogue
substantially increases the system’s input and out-
put tokens, as models must consume and produce
multiple rounds of text while processing other mod-
els’ outputs. This multi-round exchange makes the
process computationally costly and also increases
inference latency (Lin et al., 2025; Creech et al.,
2021; He et al., 2024), limiting scalability in real-
world settings. Moreover, multi-LLM frameworks
can exhibit sociological drawbacks such as process
loss (Steiner, 1972), where the collective outcome
falls short of the sum of individual contributions
due to communication friction or coordination in-
efficiencies (Diehl and Stroebe, 1987; Nooteboom
et al., 2007). Together, these issues expose a funda-
mental trade-off: while multi-LLM systems could
potentially enhance diversity and creative potential,
they do so at the expense of efficiency.

We therefore ask: Without relying on multiple
models carrying on a multi-round discussion, can a
single LLM simulate diverse perspectives in an effi-
cient manner? A natural way to explore this idea
is through prompting, that is, asking the model
to simultaneously adopt different roles and view-
points. For example, one might prompt an LLM to
act as both a creative professional and an environ-
mentalist when producing a solution that balances
originality with sustainability. However, this ap-
proach depends heavily on the model’s ability to
integrate and coordinate multiple roles and perspec-
tives within a single model and single response. In
practice, an LLM may handle each persona sepa-
rately but struggle to integrate them coherently in
a single pass, often due to limitations in capability
or the coverage of the training data (Turner et al.,
2024).

To address these challenges while retaining the
creative advantages of multi-LLM interaction, we
propose BILLY: BlendIng persona vectors for
Large Language model creativitY as illustrated
in Figure 1. Inspired by recent advances in ex-
tracting persona vectors (Chen et al., 2025) and

steering model behavior through activation engi-
neering (Turner et al., 2024; Panickssery et al.,
2024), BILLY extends these ideas by merging mul-
tiple persona vectors within a single LLM. This
enables the model to produce multi-perspective,
creative responses without resorting to computa-
tionally heavy multi-LLM frameworks. Notably,
BILLY is training-free and empirically effective
and efficient—it produces creative outputs that con-
sistently reflect the targeted personas. Our experi-
ments show that BILLY achieves higher creativity
than single-model prompting or multi-LLM meth-
ods while being substantially more cost-efficient.
We summarize our contributions as follows:

¢ Enhanced Creativity. We propose the frame-
work BILLY, which blends multiple persona
vectors within a single LLM. It enables the
generation of diverse, multi-perspective, and
creative responses, surpassing both single-
model prompting and multi-LLM approaches
on creativity-oriented benchmarks.

Efficiency and Simplicity. BILLY is en-
tirely training-free, requiring no additional
fine-tuning or multi-LLM communication. It
achieves comparable or superior creativity
with substantially lower computational and
token costs.

Interpretability via Persona Vectors. Oper-
ating directly in the latent activation space,
BILLY offers an interpretable mechanism
for understanding and steering creativity, al-
lowing fine-grained and transparent control
through persona blending.

2 Related Work

2.1 LLM Creativity

Enhancing creativity in LLMs has been a growing
research focus. One common approach involves
role-playing prompts, which guide models to adopt
specific creative personas (Chen et al., 2024a). An-
other works (Lu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b;
Su et al., 2025) explore multi-agent collaboration
frameworks, where multiple agents simulate brain-
storming sessions by proposing and critiquing ideas
to achieve more sophisticated creative outcomes.
Comprehensive reviews of this research direction
can be found in Chakrabarty et al. (2023); GOmez-
Rodriguez and Williams (2023).


2.2 Multi-LLM Collaboration

Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a power-
ful paradigm for enhancing LLM applications (Du
et al., 2023; Chan et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023; Sun
et al., 2023). AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023) enables
next-generation applications through structured
conversations, while LLM Discussion (Lu et al.,
2024) and HOLLMWOOD (Chen et al., 2024b) em-
ploy role-play and dialogue to stimulate more cre-
ative outputs. Beyond creativity, researchers have
explored emergent cognitive synergy through multi-
persona self-collaboration (Wang et al., 2024) and
applied divergent-agent systems to domain-specific
tasks such as electronic design automation (Wu
et al., 2025a). While infrastructures like Agent-
Verse (Chen et al., 2024c) and MetaGPT (Hong
et al., 2024) provide frameworks for coordination,
these collaborations can suffer from high computa-
tional costs, instability, and inefficiencies (Cemri
et al., 2025; Han et al., 2025). The complexity
of managing communication and coordination in-
creases with the number of agents, potentially lead-
ing to bottlenecks and unpredictable behaviors.

2.3 Activation Steering

Activation steering is a technology that modifies
a model’s internal activations along specific direc-
tions to control or influence its behavior (Zou et al.,
2025; Turner et al., 2024). This is achieved by
first identifying a steering vector, which represents
the desired behavioral shift. This vector is typi-
cally obtained using contrastive methods, where
the model’s activation differences are calculated
from pairs of inputs that elicit opposite behaviors
(e.g., a truthful vs. a deceptive response). During
inference, this steering vector is added to the acti-
vations at a specific layer, effectively nudging the
model’s internal state toward the intended outcome.

A key advantage of this method is that it manip-
ulates activations only at inference time without
altering the model’s underlying weights. This dis-
tinguishes it from techniques like model merging,
which operates directly on model parameters to in-
tegrate capabilities from multiple fine-tuned mod-
els (Yang et al., 2024a; Sun et al., 2025; Jang et al.,
2023), and offers a more lightweight, interpretable,
and fine-grained control over model behavior. This
technique has been applied across domains such
as enhancing truthfulness (Li et al., 2023; Pan-
ickssery et al., 2024), improving safety (Zhang
et al., 2025; Turner et al., 2024), and increasing

transparency and interpretability (Zou et al., 2025;
Jorgensen et al., 2023). Recent works have also
leveraged activation steering for persona-related
applications (Jorgensen et al., 2023; Turner et al.,
2024; Zou et al., 2025). For example, Persona Vec-
tors (Chen et al., 2025) identify activation direc-
tions corresponding to personalities for controllable
character traits, while bi-directional preference op-
timization (Cao et al., 2025) enables versatile steer-
ing vectors for fine-grained persona control.

3 Approach: BILLY

Our approach, BILLY, BlendIng persona vectors
for Large Language model creativitY, is designed
to overcome the limitations of prompting methods
(Turner et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Liang et al.,
2024; Hung et al., 2025) and the prohibitive costs
of interactive multi-agent frameworks (Su et al.,
2025; Ali et al., 2025; Lu et al., 2024). We intro-
duce a novel paradigm that shifts the control of the
model from an external, conversational system to
direct, internal representational steering to improve
LLM creativity. The core of our method is a three-
stage process: (1) extracting distinct persona vec-
tors through a contrastive method, (2) fusing these
vectors offline into a single composite steering vec-
tor, and (3) applying this vector during inference to
guide a single model.

3.1 Extracting Persona Vectors via
Contrastive Activation

A persona vector (Chen et al., 2025) represents the
characteristics of a specific persona (e.g., evil, hu-
morous) as a directional vector within the model’s
activation space (Zou et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025b;
Panickssery et al., 2024), capturing the shift in the
model’s activation states when it adopts a persona
compared to when it responds neutrally. By adding
such a vector during inference, we can steer the
model’s behavior to align with the desired persona.

Building upon the pipeline proposed by Chen
et al. (2025) for extracting persona vectors, we
create a customized dataset designed to capture
nuanced and specialized personas. This dataset en-
ables more effective handling of creativity-oriented
tasks and ensures a fair comparison with multi-
LLM systems (Lu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b;
Ali et al., 2025).

Given a persona P, we curate two distinct sets of
model responses, [oe and D5, as follows: (1) de-
sign contrastive system prompts (positive vs. nega-


tive), (2) employ an LLM judge to score the align-
ment of each response with the corresponding trait,
and (3) filter the responses with a threshold to en-
sure a clear distinction between the two corpora.

The positive-expression set DE contains re-
sponses that exhibit the persona’s traits, and the
negative-expression set D7, contains baseline re-
sponses that lack these specific traits.

For any given response x from these sets, we ex-
tract its token-averaged residual stream activation
at a specific layer 1, which we denote as @) (x).
The persona vector for persona P at layer /, de-
noted by a, is then defined as the difference be-
tween the mean activation vectors of the positive
and neutral sets:

1
=(1) _
dM) ~ BS

xeDt xeDp

_(1) 1

A
"> DB oe

(1)
This resulting vector, v () captures the directional
shift in the activation space required to induce the
persona P. This procedure is repeated for all lay-
ers, generating a unique candidate vector for each
layer. We present the detailed extraction process in
Section B.

3.2 Offline Fusion for a Composite Vector

Unlike multi-LLM systems that require costly on-
line interaction between agents, our approach fuses
these perspectives in an offline step. Given a set of
N extracted persona vectors {@1, 2,..., Ux} that
we wish to combine, we compute a single compos-
ite steering vector, Umerged, by taking their average:

1 Ly
Th eed = N » a (2)
t=1

This resulting Umergea represents a multi-faceted
perspective in the model’s activation space. This
one-time calculation yields a reusable vector that
encapsulates the essence of a multi-personality.

3.3 Inference-time Steering with Composite
Persona Vector

The final stage applies the composite vector to steer
the model’s generation process. During a standard
forward pass, when the model computes the acti-
vations a nal at a chosen steering layer / (specifi-
cally, layer 20 in our experiments, following (Chen
et al., 2025)), we intervene by adding our compos-
ite vector, scaled by a coefficient a:

(  — _ 0 3)

steered — original +a: Umerged

This simple addition acts as a directional push
in the activation space, steering the model’s sub-
sequent computations and thus its final output to-
wards a state that aligns with the fused perspectives
of the multiple personas. Crucially, this steering
process requires only a single additive operation
during each inference step and involves no addi-
tional training.

4.1 Benchmarks

To evaluate the creativity of large language models
(LLMs), we adopt a benchmark suite originally de-
rived from human creativity tests, Wallach-Kogan
Creativity Tests (Wallach, M. A., and Kogan, N.,
1965). Rather than using the original tasks directly,
we build upon a set of augmented benchmarks pre-
viously developed by Lu et al. (2024), which ex-
panded the original tasks using GPT-4 to generate
additional items. This makes our evaluation based
on a pre-augmented dataset, ensuring a broader
and more diverse set of tasks while maintaining
alignment with established creativity tests.

The benchmark set includes four benchmarks:
AUT asks for practical and innovative uses for
everyday objects; INSTANCES requires listing
items according to specific criteria; SIMILARI-
TIES involves identifying connections or similar-
ities between items; and SCIENTIFIC focuses
on producing creative solutions to scientific prob-
lems. Table 1 provides descriptions and examples
from these benchmarks, with more detailed settings
provided in the Section A.

4.2 Baselines

We include both single agent prompting methods
and multi-agent systems as our baselines. Sec-
tion A shows the prompts we use in the baseline
methods. Our baselines are as follows:

(1) Single Agent (SA): A single LLM prompted to
respond creatively, with the temperature set to 0.7,
which is acommonly used value.

(2) SA with High-temperature Decoding, SA
(T = 1.0): The temperature T is increased to 1.0
to stimulate higher levels of diversity. By allow-
ing the model to explore a broader range of possi-
ble outputs, this setting encourages more diverse
responses. We include this configuration to test
whether greater diversity in generation can lead

to more creative outcomes, though it may also in-
troduce greater variability in quality (Peeperkorn
et al., 2024).

(3) SA with Multi-Role Prompt (SA-MRP): In
addition to the standard single agent baseline, we
design a multi-role prompting variant. The prompt
here is extended with explicit persona instructions.
The model is asked to respond from multiple pro-
fessional perspectives, such as environmentalist,
creative professional, and futurist, each with dis-
tinct expertise styles. This approach is included
as a strong baseline to determine the performance
limits of enhancing creativity through prompt engi-
neering alone. By comparing our proposed BILLY
against this advanced prompting technique, we can
more clearly demonstrate the advantages of directly
manipulating the model’s internal activations over
purely prompt-level modifications.

(4) LLM Discussion: A multi-LLM framework
proposed by Lu et al. (2024), which organizes
multiple LLM agents into a structured three-
phase process—initiation, discussion, and conver-
gence—with each agent role-played under distinct
personas to diversify perspectives. Agents ex-
change ideas over several rounds and then consoli-
date them into final outputs. Our implementation
follows the original setup, including role assign-
ments and discussion prompts.

4.3 Evaluation

To quantify the creative performance of each
method, we adopt two primary metrics from the
Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT; Tor-
rance, 1966) and utilize GPT-40-mini as an LLM
judge. The TTCT is a widely respected instrument
in psychological research, valued for its reliabil-
ity in measuring creative output (Cramond et al.,

2005). From its framework, we focus on the two
key dimensions most relevant to the quality of gen-
erated ideas. We evaluate the whole QA pair with
these two metrics.

Metrics:
follows:

The specific metrics employed are as

¢ Originality: This metric assesses the sta-
tistical rarity or unconventionality of a re-
sponse. Ideas are scored based on their nov-
elty and divergence from common or obvious
answers, while still maintaining relevance to
the prompt.

¢ Elaboration: This metric measures the level
of detail and supportive information within a
response. It evaluates the ability to expand
upon a core idea, adding depth, context, and
specific details to enrich the initial concept.

The TTCT framework includes two other met-
rics: fluency and flexibility. However, as discussed
in (Lu et al., 2024), these metrics are not suitable
for assessing LLM creativity. The authors point
out that while fluency and flexibility pose signifi-
cant challenges for human subjects, they are trivial
for LLMs, which can generate responses in any
desired quantity or variety on demand. Our pre-
liminary study confirms this finding. Therefore,
since these metrics do not serve as meaningful dif-
ferentiators for LLM creativity, our evaluation will
proceed using only originality and elaboration.

aggregated across all four creativity benchmarks,
are presented in Table 2. The central finding of our
work is that BILLY consistently outperforms all
baseline methods in terms of Originality across
four benchmarks. This demonstrates the effec-
tiveness of using internal representational control
to elicit creative responses. For both Qwen and
Llama models, BILLY surpasses the strong but
costly LLM Discussion, as well as various single-
agent configurations. Notably, while the SA-MRP
occasionally provides a slight improvement over
the SA, its performance is inconsistent, reinforcing
our hypothesis that prompt-based control is inher-
ently less reliable than direct vector steering. The
Gemma-3-4B-it model, a smaller model, struggles
with limitations in the long-form, multi-round LLM
Discussion tasks, as its output tends to become un-
stable with the expanding context. We attribute its
lower scores and high variance to this instability.
Notably, while BILLY still achieved the highest
Originality score on this model in most cases, the
single-agent baselines also exhibit exceptionally
strong creative performance.

5 Discussion & Analysis

Our analysis goes beyond simple confirmation of
efficacy to provide deeper insights into the mecha-
nisms of BILLY. To dissect these mechanisms, our

discussion is structured around four concepts: (1)
The actual token cost and inference time among
different methods.(2) The relationship between the
quantity of fused vectors and the resulting creative
quality. (3) Qualitative nature of the generated text.
(4) Layer-wise projection among different methods.
The experiments in this section adopt the Llama-
3.1-8B-Instruct model, which we find sufficiently
representative for our analysis.

5.1 Token Cost and Inference Time

Table 3 details the average inference latency, input
and output token counts per query, and estimated
token cost per 10000 queries for each method. The
data clearly demonstrates BILLY’s superior effi-
ciency, reducing both token usage and associated
estimated cost by more than 95% compared to the
LLM Discussion baseline. Moreover, Section C
discusses the amortized cost of BILLY, and Sec-
tion H provides the complete chat log of a specific
agent in LLM Discussion with a single question.

Practical efficiency of BILLY is evident not only
in its token cost but also in its substantially shorter
inference time. We measured the wall-clock time
required for each method to answer 100 AUT ques-
tions and calculated the average inference latency
per query. As detailed in Table 3, BILLY is ap-
proximately 25 times faster than LLM Discussion.


This dramatic reduction in latency suggests that
our approach is a practical solution for real-time
creative generation.

5.2 Analysis of Various Vector Compositions

To investigate the relationship between the quan-
tity of fused personas and creativity, we vary the
number of merged vectors from one to seven. The
results are presented in Figure 2 with the specific
persona vector combinations detailed in Section D.
First, any vector merge with the creative profes-
sional persona results in exceptionally high cre-
ative performance. Second, while increasing the
number of persona vectors from one, i.e., 1 (CRE),
to three yields a noticeable improvement, further
additions from four to seven vectors do not produce
additional significant gains. This suggests that the
primary benefit of BILLY is not simply additive.

5.3. A Case Study on Persona Fusion

We present a case study on the Reimagine the Hos-
pital task, one of the neutral questions designed for
our activation extraction (Section 5.4). The results,
detailed in Figure 3 and Section E, demonstrate
that the individual vectors exhibit distinct func-

tions: the environmentalist generates a pragmatic
blueprint (e.g., Community Gardens), while the
creative professional produces an evocative, artistic
term (e.g., Bioluminous Biome). The merged vec-
tor demonstrates a true conceptual fusion. It retains
the substantive concepts from the environmentalist
but reframes them with the visionary style of the
creative vector. For instance, a functional "Com-
munity Garden" is transformed into an experiential
"Fractal Forest." In contrast, while prompted to
be an environmentalist and creative professional,
MRP uses relatively analytical words to convey the
concept of sustainability rather than creative ones.

Question: Healthcare Innovation - Redesign the future
hospital experience for patients, families, and staff.

MRP (CRE + ENV)

... Feasibility and Sustainability: Balance
operational costs with environmental sustainability,
energy efficiency, and long-term viability.

by models that are steered by BILLY (ENV), BILLY
(CRE), BILLY (CRE + ENV), and MRP (CRE + ENV).

5.4 Steering Alignment via Projection

To verify how effectively our method aligns model
representations with target personas, we analyze
the projection of activation changes A@\) in Equa-
tion (4) onto layer-specific persona vectors. This
analysis is conducted using 10 neutral questions
shown in Section F and 10 randomly selected ques-
tions from our evaluation dataset. The core idea is
to measure the change in the model’s activations
caused by our steering vector and then calculate
how much of the change occurred along the in-
tended persona’s direction.

This analysis involves two main steps. First, we
define the activation difference vector, AG“), for
each layer /. This vector is the difference between

=(1)

the steered activations @.,....4 from Equation (3)

a

and the original activations @,,;,;,,; from a stan-

Figure 4: Projection of Different Methods. Projection of activation changes on the layer-specific creative
professional and environmentalist persona vectors. Figures (a) and (b) show the comparison between Base Model
(without system prompt), Prompt (CRE+ENV), and BILLY (CRE+ENV). Figure (c) and (d) demonstrate the
projection of applying (i) only BILLY (CRE), (ii) only BILLY (ENV), and (iii) BILLY (CRE+ENV) at Layer 20.

dard forward pass without steering:

Aa = a sed i a inal (4)

Second, to quantify the alignment of this change

with a specific persona, we project the activation

difference vector Aa“) onto that persona’s prede-

fined, layer-specific unit persona vector. The result-

ing projection value, Projections) sona: is calcu-
lated via the dot product:

4. (l) ~(1) TO sona
Projectionpersona = Aa\’ - woh) op (5)
|| @personal|

where BO sona is the persona vector for a given
persona at layer /. A higher positive projection
value indicates that our steering intervention more
strongly shifted the model’s activations along that
persona’s semantic axis.

Superiority of Vector Steering over Prompting.
Figure 4 shows that while prompting model to be
both a creative professional and an environmental-
ist, the projection is only positive on vcreE (Fig-
ure 4a) but negative on vgyyv (Figure 4b). This
indicates that MRP fails to consistently induce all
intended personas in the model’s activations.

In stark contrast, the projections of BILLY (CRE
+ ENV) consistently being positive on both the
vcReE (Figure 4a) and veny (Figure 4b). By di-
rectly manipulating the latent space, BILLY suc-
cessfully co-activates multiple personas, validating
its superior controllability and interpretability for
complex, multi-faceted persona generation.

Efficacy of Persona Vectors Merging. Our anal-
ysis confirms the efficacy and selectivity of the in-
dividual persona vectors. As shown in Figure 4(c),
steering with only BILLY (CRE) induces a strong,
sustained projection onto the vcre, while having a

negligible effect on the vgny. Conversely, BILLY
(ENV) in Figure 4(d) strongly activates the envi-
ronmentalist axis with minimal projection onto the
creative one. This demonstrates that the extracted
vectors are highly effective, precisely controlling
their intended semantic concepts.

BILLY (CRE + ENV) reveals a more complex
and interesting interaction. Figure 4c and Figure 4d
show that BILLY (CRE + ENV) successfully co-
activates both personas, maintaining a positive pro-
jection on both vcrg and veny. However, this
co-activation does not translate linearly to the out-
put response. For instance, while the projection of
BILLY (CRE + ENV) on vere is lower than that
of BILLY (CRE) alone in Figure 4c, its Originality
score is actually higher in Figure 2.

This suggests an interesting effect just as we
discuss in Section 5.3, and Section E: the environ-
mentalist vector provides substantive content that
the creative professional vector can then reframe,
leading to a richer and more original output. Be-
sides the projection analysis, we also analyze the
trait expression of output response in Section F.

6 Conclusion

We introduce BILLY, an efficient activation steer-
ing method that enhances LLM creativity while
avoiding the high inference time and costs of multi-
LLM systems. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that our method BILLY matches
or surpasses strong creative baselines with signifi-
cantly reduced inference time and costs. Further-
more, our qualitative analysis shows that different
persona vectors influence distinct aspects of gener-
ation, such as style versus content. Via activation
projections, we suggest that BILLY offers supe-
rior controllability compared to prompting methods
over both the model’s internal state and its output.


Limitations

The main contributions of our work include: (1)
demonstrating that the creative benefits of multi-
agent collaboration can be effectively captured
within a single model via activation steering, (2)
significantly reducing the inference time and to-
ken cost for creativity tasks , and (3) revealing the
multiple role-play prompting is less controllable
and interpretable than activation steering with a
composite persona vector by several analyses.

While we recognize that developing a more so-
phisticated framework for vector composition that
moves beyond simple averaging to predictably man-
age these non-linear interactions is a key direction
for advancing controllable AI, such a method is not
directly proposed in this work. Future research can
build on our findings by developing more advanced
composition techniques. These could include learn-
ing task-specific weights for each persona vector
or designing mechanisms that explicitly model the
functional roles to achieve more precise control.
Such advancements would support the develop-
ment of more generalizable and robustly control-
lable models capable of complex, multi-faceted
reasoning.

A Prompt Design

Tables 4 and 5 present the prompts used in the base-
line, including Single Agent, Single Agent with
Multiple Role Prompt, and LLM Discussion. In
these tables, the sections highlighted in yellow in-
dicate the task descriptions. The current example
shows the AUT task, but the highlighted part will
change depending on the specific task. Descrip-
tions for different tasks are provided in Table 6.
Additionally, while the original dataset from LLM
Discussion (Lu et al., 2024) originally asked mod-
els to generate “‘as many as possible" responses,
we observed that this instruction posed challenges
for smaller language models. To ensure fairness
and comparability, we modified these prompts to
instead request five responses. In the LLM Discus-
sion setting, prompts vary not only with the task but
also with the role assignments of different agents.
These role-specific variations are highlighted in
blue, and the full list of role settings is provided
in Table 7. The prompt templates used for LLM
evaluation are presented in Tables 8, 9, and 10.

B_ Methodology for Persona Vector
Extraction

To extract our persona vectors, we adapt the con-
trastive activation methodology from Chen et al.
(2025), focusing on the complex professional roles

12

defined in Lu et al. (2024). Unlike the original
method which targeted simple personality traits
like evil, humorous, our work required vectors for
roles like creative professional or environmentalist
to align with our creativity benchmarks. This ne-
cessitated the creation of a bespoke dataset and a
complete pipeline for extraction, which we detail
below.

The process begins with generating two contrast-
ing sets of model responses for each target persona
P. First, we used Claude-sonnet-4 to create five dis-
tinct positive system prompts that exemplify each
persona’s unique traits (e.g., an environmentalist’s
perspective on a problem). These prompts are de-
tailed in Table 11 and 12.

Next, we generated responses to 20 trait-eliciting
questions using both the positive prompts and a
standard neutral prompt (e.g., "You are a help-
ful assistant."). To ensure a clear distinction be-
tween persona-aligned and neutral behavior, each
response was then scored for trait expression (0-
100) by an LLM-judge (GPT-40-mini), a technique
validated by Chen et al. (2025). Based on these
scores, we curated two final datasets:

* The positive-expression set (D7), containing
positive-prompt responses with scores greater
than 50.

* The neutral-expression set (D5), containing
neutral-prompt responses with scores less than
50.

Finally, we calculate the persona vector by con-
trasting the internal activations of these two sets.
For each response x in these datasets, we extract
its token-averaged residual stream activation at a
specific layer 1, denoted as @")(x). The persona
vector a is then defined as the difference between
the mean activation vectors of the two sets:

=F  MeQ)-+ YT MW

xeD} IDp| xeD5
(6)

+
|D>|
This procedure is repeated for all layers, generat-
ing a unique candidate vector for each layer, from
which an optimal layer is later selected for our ex-
periments.

C Amortized Cost of Persona Vector
Generation

An advantage of BILLY is that the initial, one-time
cost of generating the persona vectors is amortized


over subsequent uses. As shown in Figure 5, the
average cost per query for BILLY decreases dra-
matically as the number of queries increases. All
inference experiments were conducted on a ma-
chine with an NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPU run-
ning Ubuntu 22.04.

D_ Persona Vector Combinations for
Discussion Section

Section 5.2 (Table 2) systematically varies the num-
ber of merged vectors. The specific combinations
of personas used for each experimental condition
are detailed in Table 13.

E Comprehensive Qualitative Result

We present the qualitative results for same question,

"Healthcare Innovation (Reimagine the Hospital)
Redesign the future hospital experience for patients,
families, and staff. Address flows, safety, data, well-
being, equity, and feasibility.", of the model steered
by single CRE vector, single ENV vector, merged
CRE and ENV vector, and prompt the model to be
CRE and ENV in Table 14, 15, 16, and 17. Qualita-
tive analysis of the outputs (Tables 14, 15, and 16)
reveals a functional distinction between the per-
sonas. The creative professional persona primarily
influences the linguistic style of the response, intro-
ducing more artistic and descriptive language. In
contrast, the environmentalist persona affects the
core content, shaping the ideas and structure of the
output. Consequently, the merged vector, BILLY
(CRE + ENV), synthesizes these roles: it generates
responses with the thematic structure of the envi-
ronmentalist, but in the polished and creative style
of the creative professional.

F Trait Expression Scores Results

Beyond the sheer quantity of vectors, another sig-
nificant findings emerge from analyzing how differ-
ent methods affect the persona of output responses.
Our experiments, conduct on a trait-neutral dataset
(Table 19) and evaluate using a distributed scoring
method, using Gemini-2.5-pro, Gemini-2.0-flash,
and GPT-40-mini as LLM judges and average the
given scores to reduce the variance and bias. Specif-
ically, we ask LLM judges to distribute 100 scores
to each persona with evaluation prompts in Ta-
ble 20. Table 18 reveals that SA (Baseline) and
SA-MRP (ENV + CRE + FUT) have almost the
same trait expression score among all of the per-
sonas, which confirms that the ability of steering
persona via prompt is limited. In contrast, while
the model is steered by single vector (either CRE
or ENV), the desired trait expression score is sig-
nificantly higher than SA (Baseline). However, we
find that BILLY operates not as a simple summa-
tion of traits, where vectors exhibit complex effects
and collaboration as we discussed in Appendix E.


For instance, while the BILLY (CRE + ENV) main-
tains the skeleton of environmentalist, it uses the
creative term to decorate the responses, which we
hypothesize would be more easily to be judge. As
a result, the LLM judges give higher scores on
creativity rather than environmentalist.

G_ Process Loss Analysis of LLM
Discussion

The multi-agent discussion log (Table 21) serves as
a compelling illustration of the spectrum of process
loss within collaborative LLM systems. The exam-
ple of "a book and a magazine" epitomizes severe
process loss, particularly in the forms of coordina-
tion and motivational failures. Despite their distinct
roles, the agents exhibit substantial redundancy,
repeatedly converging on overlapping concepts
such as narrative and visual appeal across multi-
ple rounds. More critically, they fail to achieve
synthesis: each agent largely disregards the con-
tributions of its peers, resulting in conversational
stagnation where the final output is little more than
a rephrasing of the initial proposal. Consequently,
the collective performance is substantially less than
the sum of its potential parts, reflecting agents that
operate in parallel silos rather than as a cohesive
team. This leads to redundancy, inflated time costs,
and overall inefficiency.
