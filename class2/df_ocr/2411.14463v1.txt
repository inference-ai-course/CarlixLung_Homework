ABSTRACT

This paper explores the growing impact of AI and NLP in bank marketing, highlighting their evolv-
ing roles in enhancing marketing strategies, improving customer engagement, and creating value
within this sector. While AI and NLP have been widely studied in general marketing, there is a no-
table gap in understanding their specific applications and potential within the banking sector. This
research addresses this specific gap by providing a systematic review and strategic analysis of AI
and NLP applications in bank marketing, focusing on their integration across the customer journey
and operational excellence.

Employing the PRISMA methodology, this study systematically reviews existing literature to assess
the current landscape of AI and NLP in bank marketing. Additionally, it incorporates semantic map-
ping using Sentence Transformers and UMAP for strategic gap analysis to identify underexplored
areas and opportunities for future research.

The systematic review reveals limited research specifically focused on NLP applications in bank
marketing. The strategic gap analysis identifies key areas where NLP can further enhance market-
ing strategies, including customer-centric applications like acquisition, retention, and personalized
engagement, offering valuable insights for both academic research and practical implementation.

This research contributes to the field of bank marketing by mapping the current state of AI and NLP
applications and identifying strategic gaps. The findings provide actionable insights for developing
NLP-driven growth and innovation frameworks and highlight the role of NLP in improving oper-
ational efficiency and regulatory compliance. This work has broader implications for enhancing
customer experience, profitability, and innovation in the banking industry.

1 Introduction

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping bank marketing strategies, marking a new era in
how financial institutions engage clients. This builds upon foundational digital marketing principles in customer re-
lationship management (CRM) and personalization, as highlighted by [2017], who emphasized the
transformative role of digital technologies in enhancing the marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion). AI rep-
resents a substantial technological shift and offers new opportunities in data processing and predictive analytics. In the
banking sector, AI’s role is particularly significant due to the industry’s unique challenges, including the intangibility
of products, higher security requirements, and the need for complex computations within strict regulatory frameworks,
necessitating distinct Al-driven marketing approaches.

AI can process unstructured data in order to enhance value and revenue in bank marketing. This potential for deeper

insights into consumer behavior, highlighted by |Wedel and Kannanj [2016], remains underexplored, partly due to

confidentiality issues in customer data. The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as a marketing tool has not
been fully leveraged, indicating a gap between AI’s potential and its current use in bank marketing. This motivates a


Leveraging AI and NLP for Bank Marketing

two-step approach: first, conducting a systematic review to synthesize existing knowledge, and second, performing a
strategic gap analysis using advanced semantic mapping techniques to identify opportunities for NLP-enhanced bank
marketing strategies.

This research aims to systematically review and synthesize the literature on AI in bank marketing, with a particular
focus on uncovering the potential and opportunities of NLP within this field. Specifically, the goal is to examine how
NLP can enhance customer engagement, streamline operations, and improve decision-making. The aim is to identify
applications and opportunities for value creation and provide strategic recommendations for effective NLP utilization
by bank marketers.

Previous studies have reviewed NLP applications in general marketing (e.g.,{Berger et al.][2020],/Mustak et al.][2021],
[Shankar and Parsana](2022]), examining how automated textual analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis can
generate strategic insights. Within finance, NLP reviews primarily address operational efficiency and consumer be-
havior (e.g., (2016), (2022}). However, few studies focus on the application of NLP
specifically in bank marketing, where unique challenges related to regulatory constraints and complex customer inter-
actions persist. This gap underscores the need for targeted research to explore how NLP can be adapted to the distinct
requirements of bank marketing.

This study contributes to the literature on AI in bank marketing as follows: First, using the PRISMA methodology
[2009], it systematically reviews (1) AI and advanced analytics applications in bank marketing and (2)
NLP-specific implementations in general marketing, identifying current trends. Second, it combines both PRISMA
results in an Al-enhanced gap analysis to highlight underexplored areas and opportunities for NLP-based bank mar-
keting strategies. The gap analysis employs semantic mapping techniques, specifically Sentence Transformers with
UMAP, to uncover new research avenues and visualize the landscape of existing studies. Finally, the analysis shows
how NLP can transform customer engagement, marketing strategy, and operational excellence to drive growth and
innovation in banking.

2 Prisma Methodology and Data Collection

This section outlines the methodology for the first step of this study: the systematic review of AI applications in bank
marketing, focusing specifically on the potential of NLP.

2.1 PRISMA Methodology

This review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework

to thoroughly explore AI and NLP applications in bank marketing [2009]. A detailed search strategy
is implemented using Scopus as the primary database for identifying the relevant literature. Scopus was selected
because of its extensive coverage of peer-reviewed journals in various disciplines, including finance, technology, and
marketing. The search strategy aimed to capture a broad spectrum of AI applications, particularly through digital

CRM and personalized marketing.

The selection criteria were designed to ensure high-quality studies. Only peer-reviewed articles published between
2014 and 2024 were included, to reflect advancements in NLP after the introduction of Word2Vec |Mikolov et al.
2013]. The criteria included journals ranked C or higher, according to the ABDC Journal Quality List, and conference

papers were excluded to maintain consistency and quality.

2.1.1 Data Extraction and Analysis

Data extraction and analysis were conducted in several iterations to ensure thorough coverage and understanding:

1.

Identification: Initial database searches using the pre-defined Boolean queries yielded a preliminary pool of
records.

Screening: Records were screened based on titles and keywords, filtering out irrelevant studies and removing
duplicates.

. Eligibility: Abstracts were reviewed for eligibility, focusing on analytical bank marketing and NLP-based

marketing. Only peer-reviewed journal articles were included.
Inclusion: The final selection of studies was based on their direct relevance to the research objectives.

Additional Sources: Additional studies relevant to the research field were included if not identified in the
initial search.

The iterative process led to a thematic synthesis that identified key themes in this first part of the study. Research gaps
will be identified at a later stage.

3.2 Thematic Classification

An exploratory analysis of the reviewed literature allowed us to group the two queries into three main dimensions:

CRM, marketing mix, and strategic insights. These dimensions are also supported by 2017] and
Shankar and Parsana} [2022]. This classification provides a structured approach to understanding how AI and NLP

enhance different aspects of bank marketing and lays the foundation for a deeper exploration of these themes in the
following sections. Table [3|presents the thematic distribution of the reviewed studies.

The CRM dimension highlights a stronger focus on retention over acquisition, underscoring banks’ emphasis on long-
term relationships. In the Marketing Mix, AI and NLP are primarily applied to product innovation and promotion,
while pricing and placement receive less focus. The Strategic Insights dimension captures AI and NLP’s role in
competitor and feedback analysis, which supports data-driven decision-making.

In the next subsection, we will classify the selected MarketingBanking papers and analyze them in detail to better
understand how each dimension shapes the application of AI and NLP in bank marketing.

Leveraging AI and NLP for Bank Marketing

3.3.1 Customer Relationship in AI-driven Bank Marketing

The enhancement of customer relationships through AI technologies exemplifies a multi-dimensional approach.
Specifically, AI has been instrumental in transforming how banks acquire and retain customers.

Customer Acquisition. AJ-driven customer acquisition strategies have demonstrated significant potential for opti-
mizing marketing efforts. For instance, [Quijano-Sanchez and Liberatore] developed a decision support system
for Banco Santander, which utilized client and operational data to identify the most reliable sequences for client acqui-
sition and cross-selling. This decision support system employed state-of-the-art models, including a reliability graph
and a probability function, to optimize the client acquisition process. Similarly, Schwartz et al/] optimized on-
line display ad impressions using multi-armed bandit methods and hierarchical models, achieving an 8% improvement
in customer acquisition without additional costs. Adaptive learning and real-time data optimization are thus effective
methods to enhance customer acquisition strategies in banks.

Customer Retention. Predictive models for customer retention have been instrumental in reducing churn rates, en-
abling banks to maintain a stable customer base and mitigate revenue losses. Various studies have employed advanced
AI and ML techniques to enhance these predictive models and develop effective retention strategies.

Giir Ali and Aritiirk}[[2014] introduced a dynamic churn prediction framework using horizon-specific binary classifiers.

Their Multiple Period Training Data (MPTD) approach increased the size of the training data set and reduced the rarity
of churn events, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The study makes use of logistic regression, survival analysis,
and Cox regression on customer records from a European bank and specifically deals with rate churn events.

Leveraging big data analytics, Shirazi and Mohammadi} |2019] developed a model to identify churn patterns among

retirees in the Canadian banking industry. By analyzing unstructured data from online web pages, website visits, and
phone conversation logs, the study provided a view of customer behavior, enabling targeted retention strategies. The
integration of diverse data sources has been a subject of investigation in the field of churn prediction modeling.
used a dataset from Kaggle consisting of 10,000 bank customer records with variables such as socio-
demographic characteristics, balance, estimated salary, and tenure. They forecast customer attrition using logistic
regression and random forest. The random forest classifier demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, enabling banks
to implement preemptive measures to retain valuable customers. [2020] enhanced churn prediction by
incorporating textual data from customer communications with advisors. The study improved the accuracy of churn
prediction models by using logistic regression and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which provided deeper
insights into customer behavior and communication patterns.

combined logistic regression, stepwise selection, and Weight of Evidence (WOE) variables to
forecast customer churn and Net Promoter Score (NPS). The study identified strong predictors, such as customer age
and the number of insurance contracts, which enabled targeted actions to retain customers. Similarly,
leveraged unstructured call log data and text mining techniques, integrating features into a multi-stacking ensemble
model. This approach provided deeper insights into customer behavior and risk factors, enabling more effective and
personalized retention strategies.

Studies such as that of have focused on segmenting customers based on their loyalty behaviors to
develop targeted retention strategies. Employing sequence analysis, the research segments customers into six distinct
groups: Loyalist, Switching Loyalist, Switching Defector, Defector, Dormant Loyalist, and Dormant Defector. These
groups show varying profitability, allowing banks to allocate marketing resources more effectively. Tree-based models,
exemplified in the work of utilizing the C5 decision tree algorithm, are robust predictors of
customer churn. Their model identifies key predictors, such as total transaction count and revolving balance, which
can be used to inform proactive measures to retain customers and enhance stability.

Moreover, the efficacy of stochastic models in forecasting customer activity and retention in noncontractual settings
was validated by through the use of transaction data to classify active customers with high accuracy.
[2022] evaluated the effectiveness of various ML techniques in predicting used auto loan churn among
subprime borrowers, identifying significant variables such as loan-to-value ratio and FICO credit score to inform the
development of targeted interventions.

Finally, hybrid models have demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing the accuracy of churn prediction.

Rouhani and Mohammadi [2023] combined decision trees and multinomial regression to categorize customers into

three distinct classes: non-churn, prone to churn, and churn. This approach yielded an average accuracy of 87.66%. In

addressing data imbalance in churn prediction, |Simsek and Tas} [2023] employed a hybrid model combining random
oversampling (ROS) and voting (RF-LGBM), achieving high accuracy (95%) and Fl-score (0.95) and effectively

identifying at-risk customers.

Leveraging AI and NLP for Bank Marketing

Together, these studies collectively underscore the importance of leveraging advanced analytics and AI techniques to
enhance customer retention strategies in the banking sector. By accurately predicting customer churn and understand-
ing the underlying factors, banks can develop targeted interventions that maintain a stable customer base and improve
profitability.

3.3.2 Marketing Mix in AI-driven Bank Marketing

AI technologies enable banks to optimize the 4 P’s of the marketing mix, enhancing customer engagement, improving
operational efficiency, and driving revenue growth. This section explores how AI-driven approaches have the potential
to transform products, pricing strategies, channel selection, and promotional activities.

Product Innovation. explored the enhancement of financial advisory services in wealth man-
agement through individualized asset allocation recommendations. To this end, they employed case-based reasoning
and diversification strategies, with the objective of creating personalized investment portfolios. The results of their
investigation demonstrated that these AlI-driven portfolios could align with clients’ risk profiles and potentially offer
superior yields compared to traditional human advisor recommendations. Consequently, they concluded that the use
of AI in wealth management could improve the advisory process.

Pricing Strategies. In their respective hing eves Ban and Keskin explored dynamic
pricing models with the objective of optimizing revenue. 2021] demonstrated the effectiveness of
personalized dynamic pricing using high-dimensional customer features and heterogeneous price elasticity. The study
employed machine learning (ML) techniques such as lasso regularization and maximum quasi-likelihood regression,
achieving a 47% increase in expected revenue over a six-month period. formulated dynamic and
static pricing models for home loans to optimize the net present value (NPV) of cash flows over a 15-year period. The
study used data from a nationalized bank in India, employing quadratic programming. The dynamic pricing model
generally yielded higher expected revenue compared to the static model, particularly for linear demand functions. This
suggested that continuously adjusting loan interest rates in response to market conditions could significantly enhance
a bank’s revenue.

Place Strategies. 2017] addressed optimal channel selection by optimizing online display ad im-

pressions to improve customer acquisition rates. Using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods and hierarchical models,
the study dynamically adjusted ad placements based on real-time data, addressing the "learn-and-earn" trade-off.
Implemented in a live field experiment, the system achieved an 8% improvement in customer acquisition without
additional costs, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing customer acquisition strategies through adaptive learning
and real-time data optimization.

Promotional Activities. The application of AI has significantly enhanced the efficacy of promotional strategies of
banks. AlJ-driven marketing efforts are now more personalized and efficient than traditional methods. For instance,
2015] demonstrated how AI can be leveraged to enhance wealth management. This was achieved by uti-
lizing AI for individualized investment recommendations through case-based reasoning and diversification strategies.
These approaches yielded superior yields and more closely aligned with clients’ risk profiles than traditional methods.

Michel et al.|[2017] optimized direct marketing campaigns by using decision trees and a new y°-statistic to accurately
orecast campaign-related uplifts, identifying customers likely to respond positively. This approach maximized cam-

paign impact and efficiency. compared multi-label classification techniques and recommender
systems. Their findings indicated that user-based collaborative filtering and classifier chains with Adaboost were the
most effective for cross-selling in the financial sector. These methods enhanced the prediction and recommendation of
pertinent products to customers.

In retail banking, |Ladyzynski et al.|[/2019] utilized ML models, including random forests and deep belief networks, to

predict customers’ likelihood of purchasing credit products. This approach allowed for optimal timing and personal-
ized offers, increasing the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns. integrated fog
computing and hybrid recommendation methodologies to provide real-time, personalized product suggestions, such

accurate personality profiling. The results indicate that extroverted consumers demonstrated a greater responsiveness
to advertisements that evoked excitement and social rewards, whereas neurotic consumers exhibited a preference for
messages that reduced perceived risks and provided social acceptance cues. This tailored advertising approach led to
a notable improvement in click-through and conversion rates.

aimed to enhance the efficacy of bank telemarketing sales through the implementation of a dynamic
ensemble selection method (META-DES-AAP). This method considered both the accuracy and the average profit of
the telemarketing campaigns. The insights gained from this method enabled more informed and strategic marketing
decisions. employed a Class Membership-Based (CMB) classifier to improve the prediction
of successful telemarketing campaigns. The CMB approach, which processes heterogeneous data such as age, marital
status, and educational level, achieved high accuracy (97.3%) and an AUC score (95.9%) through precise targeting of
potential customers.

The ethical considerations of promotional activities were addressed by|Radovanovic et al.| 2023], who introduced a

fair classifier chain approach to avoid gender bias in predictive models. The study highlighted a trade-off between
increased fairness (by 7% to 17%) and a slight decrease in predictive performance (up to 9% in AUC), emphasizing
the importance of ethical considerations in marketing strategies.

Finally, [Boustani et al-]/2023] demonstrated the value of transaction data in improving cross-selling models using deep
learning networks. By analyzing nearly 800,000 credit card transactions, the study showed that integrating transaction

data with demographic and product ownership data significantly enhanced predictive accuracy. The heterogeneous
ensemble model achieved an AUC of 0.932, highlighting the potential for optimized promotional efforts in retail
banking.

3.3.3 Strategic Insights in AI-driven Bank Marketing

With AI, banks extend marketing beyond traditional metrics, offering insights into competitors and customers. This
knowledge streamlines decision-making for market positioning.

Competitor Analysis. demonstrated the use of social media data for competitive analysis in
Nigeria’s banking industry. By employing text mining, sentiment analysis, and k-means clustering techniques, the
study analyzed unstructured text content from Facebook and X/Twitter accounts of the largest banks. This analy-
sis provided deep insights into customer sentiments and engagement, enabling banks to understand their competitive
positioning and devise strategic marketing initiatives. The study demonstrates the potential for banks to make in-
formed decisions and enhance their competitive edge in the market by transforming social media data into actionable
knowledge.

Feedback Analysis. In order to gain knowledge about the service quality and satisfaction of customers, the study

conducted by|Chakrabarti et al.|/2018] analyzed online customer reviews. The analysis was conducted using sentiment

analysis, which enabled the researchers to identify the dimensions of service that had the greatest impact on customer
satisfaction. These dimensions included responsiveness and tangibles. Similarly, [2021] utilized topic
modeling to analyze customer feedback from a bank’s satisfaction survey, identifying key topics that influence satis-
faction levels.

Other Insights. Beyond competitor and feedback analysis, Al-driven analytics generate valuable insights that en-
hance customer relationships and profitability in banking. proposed integrating performance
management with customer management using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) as a financial metric. This integrative
approach employed a variety of techniques, including genetic K-means, analytic hierarchical processes, and data en-
velopment analysis, to segment customers into distinct clusters. calculated a Customer
Potential Value (CPV) through a probit model and panel data of Spanish banks. The researchers identified a number of
key determinants of future profits, including the length of the relationship, product usage, and cross-buying behavior.
Furthermore, utilized data mining techniques, including fuzzy analytic hierarchy process
(FAHP) and K-means clustering, to construct a customer value pyramid. This approach yielded valuable insights into
customer behavior and preferences, thereby facilitating the development of more effective customer relationship man-
agement strategies. Additionally, [Mancisidor et al.| [2021] employed a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn latent
representations of bank customers’ data, specifically to reflect their creditworthiness. By transforming the input data
using Weight of Evidence (WoE), the VAE created meaningful latent spaces that clustered customers based on their
likelihood of default. This clustering allowed banks to better understand customer segments and to enable a more
efficient customer relationship management. These customer insights are frequently linked with subsequent marketing
actions for profit generation.

3.4 Natural Language Processing in Marketing (Prisma Query 2)

Following the analysis of AI applications in bank marketing, we now turn to the broader landscape of general mar-
keting studies utilizing NLP (MarketingNLP). As a subset of AI, NLP has been widely used to analyze and interpret
human language in various marketing contexts. Inspired by [Berger et al.|[2020], we begin by examining the Textual
Universe in Marketing, focusing on text producers and receivers, including sources like social media posts, customer
reviews, and call logs. Understanding these data flows is crucial for effective NLP applications. Next, we explore
NLP models and techniques for Decoding Texts in Marketing, such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling, which
are essential for generating insights. After the publication of [2020], transformer-based models have
further revolutionized the field of NLP, adding new capabilities not covered in their analysis. Finally, we categorize
the reviewed studies by industry sectors to identify potential improvements in banking from other sectors. This second
PRISMA review provides the basis for our subsequent gap analysis, which will delve into further applications of NLP
in bank marketing.

3.4.1 Textual Universe in Marketing

To effectively apply NLP in marketing, it is crucial to understand the sources of textual data. Following
2020], we distinguish between text producers and receivers, focusing primarily on firms and customers as the key
stakeholders.

Table|[5|categorizes the types of texts produced and received by firms and customers, based on the textual data used in
the included studies. It illustrates the diversity of textual data available for NLP in analytical marketing. As shown,
a substantial portion of the text generated in marketing originates from customers, such as feedback, reviews, social
media posts, and user-generated content. These sources are heavily researched for understanding customer sentiment
and behavior. Firms, as the primary recipients, derive actionable insights and business value from these data sources,
although other customers may also consume the content.

Firms also produce text, with a more balanced distribution between customers and internal recipients. Direct commu-
nication with customers, such as marketing messages, online ads, chatbot interactions, and content marketing tweets,
has emerged as a significant area of interest. Internally, firms generate reports and operational texts.

3.4.2 Decoding Texts in Marketing with NLP

NLP has revolutionized marketing by providing tools to analyze and interpret vast amounts of textual data. This
enables marketers to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and sentiments. In this section, we
explore advanced NLP methodologies and their applications in marketing, as summarized in|Table 6

Sentiment and Emotion Analysis. A predominant area of interest within NLP studies in marketing is the investi-
gation of customer sentiment and emotions. Sentiment analysis is a technique that identifies and categorizes opinions
expressed in texts to determine the overall attitude of an individual or a group towards a particular product or brand.
This attitude can be represented numerically or classified into opinion polarity classes, which include positive, neutral,

2022)|Afolabi et al.|/2017]. Such analysis is beneficial for providing timely feedback, managing brand reputation,
shaping marketing strategies, and gaining more profound insights into brand perception.

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) provides a more granular perspective compared to general sentiment anal-
ysis, allowing firms to identify specific features or aspects of products and services that drive customer satisfaction

[Liu et al.|/2024||Lappeman et al.||2022}|Vassilikopoulou et al.||2022]. This technique differentiates between different

aspects of products mentioned within the text, providing a targeted understanding of customer feedback.
An even more complex method for analyzing customer sentiments is Multimodal Emotion Recognition [Chen et al.|
2022]. This method interprets emotions through multiple data types, including speech-to-text and image data. This

represents the cutting-edge of sentiment analysis, offering deeper insights that can be used to tailor marketing strategies
effectively.

Sentiment Analysis is often integrated with other NLP methods, such as topic modeling, to enhance the understanding

of customer feedback [Barbosa et al.||2023].

Topic Modeling. Topic modeling is a set of techniques that can be used to identify hidden topics or trends within
textual datasets. In the field of marketing, topic modeling is employed to derive valuable insights about customers,
including customer preferences and market trends.

The majority of studies in this field employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with a fixed number k; of latent topics

to be identified in a text corpus. LDA, for instance, has been effectively used by|Le et al.] [2024] and

2023] to aid in market segmentation and trend analysis. For example, LDA has been applied to customer reviews and
social media posts to uncover underlying themes, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies accordingly

[Nicolau et al.}|2024].

Closely related to this is Correlated Topic Modeling (CTM), which allows for correlations between topics, providing

a nuanced understanding of thematic relationships within a dataset [Garner et al.||2022]. This approach is particularly
valuable for datasets where topics are likely to be interrelated, such as customer reviews spanning multiple product

categories.

Newer methods, such as transformer-based language models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations

from Transformers), are gaining popularity in the field of topic modeling and sentiment analysis | Yazici and Ozan-

2023]. By leveraging pre-trained embeddings, these models facilitate more accurate topic identification,
thereby improving the semantic understanding of text.

Natural Language Generation. The fields of Natural Language Generation (NLG), Conversational AI, and Gener-
ative AI (GenAI) have recently attracted significant interest from researchers and practitioners alike, with new appli-
cations in marketing emerging.

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT has facilitated the creation of marketing content through

user prompts, offering a new level of versatility in text generation |Tafesse and Wood} |2024]. In marketing practice,

the underlying data and the desired outcome shape the complexity of the prompt engineering process. LLMs enable
marketers to create highly personalized content, enhancing customer engagement.

A related development is the integration of LLMs into customer-facing interactions, such as chatbots [Jin and Eastin|
2023)\|}Kushwaha and Kar} |2021] or voice systems [Rhee and Choi) |2020]. LLMs can provide the textual basis and

analytics tools out of the box to handle customer queries and automate sales processes. These chatbots can simulate
human-like interactions, thereby improving customer satisfaction and engagement.

In addition to customer interactions, NLG can also generate high-quality SEO content, which is essential for im-
proving search engine rankings and attracting more visitors to websites. The use of transfer learning in this context

analysis or topic modeling. For instance, it becomes possible to create highly customized features and models to
predict customers’ intentions, such as the likelihood of a return visit to a hotel [Marandi et al.}|2024]. In the context of
unstructured data, the architectures of these models are often complex. To capture non-trivial, nonlinear, and hidden

relationships within text data, deep neural networks are employed|De Caigny et al.||2020]. These models are capable

of performing tasks such as sales forecasting or the construction of efficient recommender systems, as evidenced by
prior research (Shambour 2023 2019).

Identifying similarities between customers, products, or brands can be performed by vector-based text similarity anal-
ysis. In order to achieve this, the respective text objects (words, sentences, collections of texts) are transformed into
embeddings. There are a number of different approaches that can be employed in this regard, including the use of word
embeddings with Word2Vec, document embeddings with Doc2Vec/Paragraph2Vec, and traditional lexical matching
techniques such as TF-IDF [Ghasemi and Momtazi\ [2021]. In vectorized form, these objects can be compared and the
degree of similarity quantified. Word embeddings, for instance, can effectively capture semantic similarities between
customer interactions . Additionally, using word embeddings enhances the understand-
ing of customer needs from reviews [Timoshenko and Hauser] |2019]. Clustering algorithms can then group similar
objects based on shared characteristics or behaviors, thus facilitating text-based customer and market segmentation.
This enables the categorization of customers into groups based on their reviews and feedback, as well as the segmen-

tation of brands into distinct markets [Marandi et al.) /2024 2022\. Furthermore, text-based similarities
can be leveraged to build recommender systems based on collaborative filtering |Ghasemi and Momtazi\|2021].

Text parsing and entity extraction are also frequently used in NLP to structure information from unstructured text.
This is particularly relevant for corporate reports and documents, enabling firms to automate and streamline marketing

processes effectively [Cooper et al.}|2022 2023).

In addition to these techniques, syntactic surprise analysis and emerging pattern mining provide further capabilities
for custom marketing analyses. The application of syntactic surprise analysis allows for the evaluation of unexpected
syntactic structures within text. This can be used to improve the effectiveness of marketing messages through moderate

surprise [Atalay et al.|/2023]. Emerging pattern mining focuses on significant changes in data patterns over time. With
this information, marketing strategies can be proactively adapted based on shifting customer behaviors and market

Visualizations. Visualizations give marketers further guidance to effectively analyze unstructured textual data and
generate actionable insights. Techniques such as word clouds and perceptual maps help visualize frequently occurring
terms and relationships within data. Word clouds are a visual representation of the most frequently occurring terms in
text data and can provide an intuitive overview of customer feedback and reviews [Kim et al.|[2022].

Perceptual Maps use dimensionality reduction to plot high-dimensional textual vector representations in a manner that
is comprehensible to humans, typically in two dimensions. Clusters and relationships in the data can then be identified
via the data points in the plot. In marketing, perceptional maps are used to illustrate customer preferences or brand

positioning in a competitive market [Alzate et al.|/2022 2016]. These maps reveal the relative positioning

of products or brands, thereby highlighting areas for potential improvement or differentiation.

3.4.3 NLP Studies by Industries

Table [7] summarizes NLP marketing studies by sector, highlighting the distribution of research efforts and sector-
specific trends. Examining these studies reveals that the majority of research is not focused on banking and finance.
By analyzing the approaches and findings from other sectors, we can identify valuable insights and methods that may
be applicable to improving NLP-based marketing in the banking sector.

Automotive. The automotive sector has effectively utilized NLP to unveil consumer preferences and analyze product
defects through online reviews. Studies such as{Liu et al.|(2024], [Sun et al.|[2022], and{Liu et al.|[2019] emphasize the

use sentiment analysis to improve recommendation accuracy. Al-driven chatbots are also significant, with studies

like 2023] and |Sidlauskiene et al.| [2023] exploring their role in enhancing customer interaction and

personalizing shopping.

Analyzing customer feedback is crucial for refining marketing strategies. |Wu and Chang} ||2020] and
2023] used text-mining techniques to identify key topics and sentiments in reviews, providing insights

into customer preferences and areas for improvement. Cross-cultural and multilingual aspects are also considered, as
in{Le et al.|[2024], ensuring a comprehensive understanding of diverse customer bases.

Emerging technologies like voice shopping and multimodal content analysis are explored in studies such as|Rhee and
and {Liu et al.|(2023]. These innovations highlight the evolving landscape of e-commerce and the need
for continuous adaptation of new technologies. Overall, the extensive research in e-commerce demonstrates NLP’s
significant role in enhancing online shopping by improving customer experience, personalizing marketing efforts, and
driving sales through the effective use of NLP technologies.

Additionally, Timoshenko and Hauser} [2019] demonstrates the use of NLP to identify customer needs and improve

product development across various industries. By analyzing user-generated content, companies can better under-
stand customer preferences and enhance their marketing strategies to address specific concerns and improve overall
satisfaction.

Entertainment & Events. NLP techniques are crucial in the Entertainment and Events sectors for analyzing cus-
tomer reviews to enhance service quality and predict performance. Studies like{Loupos et al.|[2023] and (2020)

and brand positioning. [2022] introduces a customer requirement identification framework using sentiment
polarity to categorize product attributes for better product design strategies. utilizes sentiment
analysis and opinion retrieval from social media to support product development and innovation, exemplified by the
case of Google Glass. These insights help companies in product development, marketing strategy refinement, and
competitive analysis, ultimately leading to better customer satisfaction and increased market share.

The Banking and Financial Services sector has also conducted a limited number of NLP-related studies with a focus
on marketing. A more in-depth analysis combined with a gap analysis will be presented in the following section.

4 Gap Analysis

While our systematic review provided fruitful insights into the applications of analytical bank marketing and NLP
across a range of industries, our investigation into the intersection of these two areas has revealed notable gaps. The
literature search (AllIntersect, Query 3) for studies specifically addressing NLP in bank marketing revealed a
lack of in-depth research with practical applications. This gap presents unique opportunities to enhance data-driven
decision-making and personalize customer experiences in banking, though regulatory constraints add challenges for
implementing NLP effectively in this field.

To conceptualize the research field, Figure [4] illustrates the convergence of the domains of marketing, banking, and
NLP. Engagement reflects the integration of marketing strategies to enhance the customer journey in the banking sector

Kannan and Li}|2017]. Strategy demonstrates how NLP contributes to strategic decision-making by providing insights
from textual analysis [Berger et al.||2020]. Excellence emphasizes the role of NLP in optimizing banking processes,
improving efficiency, and reducing costs [Kumar and Ravi |2016]. At the core intersection, Growth represents the

combined potential of all three domains to drive value and foster innovation in banking. These components form the
basis of our gap analysis, which explores and evaluates opportunities for NLP integration in bank marketing.

4.1 Growth with NLP-Driven Marketing Strategies

Integrating NLP in bank marketing stimulates growth by enhancing data-driven decision-making and personalized
customer interactions. To gain a deeper insight into the potential applications of NLP within bank marketing, we
conducted an AlI-based mapping and visualization of the existing MarketingBanking and MarketingNLP litera-
ture. A Sentence Transformer (all-mpnet-base-v2) was employed to process each abstract from the included studies,
transforming them into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meanings. These vectors were then projected
into a two-dimensional space using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique, which
preserves semantic relationships and allows for a visual representation of the research landscape.

The resulting visualization, presented in Figure |5| reveals both densely covered areas, indicating well-researched
topics, and sparsely populated areas that signify potential research gaps in NLP applications for bank marketing. To
identify prevalent themes and research interests, we performed manual labeling on the resulting clusters. We analyzed
the studies within the plot to determine relevant dimensions that best characterize the clustering patterns. Based on
these analyses, key dimensions and gaps were identified to guide future studies in NLP applications for bank marketing.

The map visually positions the identified marketing categories along two strategic axes. The first axis reflects the
Customer Focus vs. Strategic Focus dimension, as supported by prior research [Mustak et al.] [2021]. A second axis,
Internal Focus vs. External Focus, emerges upon further analysis. The combination of these two dimensions provides
a detailed understanding of the positioning of the marketing landscape, offering deeper insights into the strategic
application of NLP within the banking sector.

The plot reveals clustering patterns corresponding to different marketing categories. The Analytical Marketing & NLP
category (Market ingNLP) is broadly distributed across the UMAP space, showing that NLP applications in marketing
are diverse and applied across a wide range of tasks. This distribution exhibits a skew towards the External Focus and
Strategic Focus quadrants, indicating that NLP techniques are frequently utilized to analyze external data sources with
strategic objectives in mind.

In contrast, the Analytical Marketing & Banking category (MarketingBanking) demonstrates a more concentrated
clustering within the Customer Focus and Internal Focus quadrants. This reflects the traditional focus of bank mar-

keting strategies, which are centered on customer needs and reliant on internal data sources. The overlapping studies
in the Analytical Marketing & Banking & NLP category (AllIntersect) highlight the suitability of integrating NLP
into bank marketing processes, spanning both Customer Focus and Strategic Focus areas.

In a more detailed examination, the UMAP projection reveals distinct patterns across multiple marketing categories,
as shown in Figure[6] which provides a category-wise comparison.

To illustrate, the Retention category is prominently positioned in the upper-middle section of the plot, close to the
axes of Customer Focus and Internal Focus. The concentration of research and applications in this area underscores
its pivotal role in banking. The Acquisition and Insights categories are located in close proximity to one another at
the center of the plot, which suggests that these categories are distributed across the two dimensions in a multifaceted
manner. This distribution encompasses both internal and external data, as well as a combination of direct customer
engagement and strategic focus. Similarly, the Price and Promotion categories are located at the center of the plot,
reflecting different research directions and data sources. The Product, Feedback, and Competitor categories are
more closely aligned with the strategic and external focus axis. This relationship can be attributed to the nature of
feedback as an external data source, which is often used to enhance product quality. Similarly, competitor analysis
requires access to external data, which is essential for informing strategic decisions. The Place category has been
excluded from the plot due to the assignment of only a single study to this category.

Some categories exhibit a considerable degree of variance within the plot, with studies from the same category being
distributed across different quadrants. This scatter variance is also displayed in Figure|6| It illustrates that, for instance,
the Insights category, which has a high variance score, is not concentrated in any particular dimension. In contrast, the
Product category demonstrates less scatter.

The UMAP plot illustrates the integration of NLP techniques in a multitude of applications in the analytical marketing
landscape. However, it also reveals several gaps where further NLP adoption could enhance bank marketing. Notably,
the underutilization of NLP in customer-centric applications, such as retention, acquisition, and customer insights,
suggests that banks may not be fully leveraging NLP to personalize and optimize customer interactions. Addressing
these gaps can enhance customer engagement and foster growth in banking, which we explore further in the following
subsection.

4.2 Growth with NLP-Driven Customer Engagement

To address the identified gaps in customer engagement, we now focus on the Engagement component of our conceptual
framework (Figure (4). analyzing how NLP can enhance customer interactions across the banking customer journey.
Adapting the customer journey framework by [Kannan and Lil to a financial setting, we consider the stages
of awareness, consideration, conversion, and retention. By mapping NLP applications onto these stages, we aim to
provide actionable recommendations for banks to enhance engagement throughout the customer lifecycle, ultimately
fostering stronger customer relationships and driving growth.

Figure [J illustrates how NLP-driven marketing actions and strategic insights can enhance customer engagement at
each stage of the journey.

In the awareness stage, banks seek to attract potential customers and establish brand recognition. Our analysis in-
dicates that banks underutilize NLP in customer acquisition and competitor analysis. Traditionally, banks rely on
structured data, overlooking rich insights from unstructured data sources such as social media interactions and cus-
tomer reviews. This represents a missed opportunity to understand public perception and market trends.

Figure 7: NLP-Based Marketing Actions and Insights Across the Banking Customer Journey.

We recommend that banks employ NLP techniques like sentiment analysis and topic modeling on social media data
to gain real-time insights into customer sentiments and preferences [Afolabi et al.|/2017|{Lappeman et al. 2022). By
identifying potential customers based on online behavior and sentiments, banks can enhance their customer acquisition
efforts. Additionally, leveraging NLP for dynamic adjustment of ad content and placement can improve engagement

and acquisition rates [[Lamrhari et al.) |2022]. For effective competitor analysis, banks should analyze competitors’
customer reviews using NLP to understand market positioning and identify areas for differentiation [Schwartz et al.

2017) |Quijano-Sanchez and Liberatore}|2017].

During the consideration stage, potential customers evaluate banking options. Personalization and relevant informa-
tion are crucial, yet banks often underutilize NLP for understanding customer needs in product development, person-
alizing promotions, and optimizing channels (place) for delivering marketing messages.

To bridge this gap, banks should analyze unstructured customer feedback, such as online reviews and surveys, using

NLP to inform product development |Zhang et al.||2022| /Timoshenko and Hauser}|2019]. Techniques like sentiment

analysis and topic modeling can reveal customer preferences and areas for improvement, leading to products that

better align with customer expectations [Heidary Dahooie et al.| [2021 2022). Furthermore, integrating

NLP-driven recommender systems allows banks to offer tailored financial products and personalize promotions, en-

hancing customer engagement [Shumanov et al.| |2022!| |Tafesse and Wood) |2024]. Optimizing place involves using

NLP to analyze customer interactions across different platforms, enabling banks to deliver promotions through the
most effective channels [Schwartz et al.||2017].

At the conversion stage, customers decide to engage with a banking service. Here, price is often the primary deter-
mining factor due to the commoditized nature of banking products. However, banks rarely employ NLP to analyze
customer perceptions of pricing. Hence, they are missing opportunities to adjust pricing strategies based on customer
feedback.

We suggest that banks apply NLP to analyze customer feedback on pricing to gain insights into perceptions of price

fairness |[Lawani et al.||2019 2024|. By examining sentiments related to pricing, banks can adapt their

price models to align with customer expectations, thereby optimizing conversion rates. Additionally, NLP can support
personalized pricing by analyzing customer interactions and behaviors, enabling a more responsive and customer-

centric approach [Chen et al.|/2022].

The retention stage is concerned with the maintenance of long-term customer relationships. Banks often use ML to

detect churn signals such as reduced account activity [AL-Najjar et al.|/2022], changes in spending [Coser et al.|/2020],
and shifts in product usage | Shirazi and Mohammadi}|2019]. However, they often overlook insights from unstructured

data, such as emotional cues and context.

23


Leveraging AI and NLP for Bank Marketing

To enhance churn prevention and feedback analysis, banks should integrate NLP techniques to analyze unstructured
data sources like customer feedback, call center transcripts, and social media interactions. Recent studies have demon-
strated improved predictive accuracy and a deeper understanding of customer behavior when textual data is integrated

into the analytical process [De Caigny et al.|[2020]. For instance, sentiment analysis of social media posts can reveal
early signs of dissatisfaction, enabling proactive interventions . Analyzing call center logs
with NLP helps identify customer concerns and allows timely corrective actions (2023).
By combining NLP with structured data models, banks can develop more advanced churn prediction systems that cap-

ture both behavioral patterns and emotional indicators [Vo et al.| |2021 2022], ultimately enhancing

customer loyalty and satisfaction.

4.3 Growth with NLP-Driven Operational Excellence

Operational excellence is essential for banks seeking sustainable growth and competitive advantage. By optimizing
processes, reducing costs, and enhancing service quality, banks can improve financial profitability and build stronger
customer relationships. While pursuing these goals, banks must also consider regulatory compliance and ethical
standards as crucial preconditions, ensuring that NLP implementations are trustworthy and legally sound.

To structure our analysis, we draw on a value creation framework inspired by 2017], focusing on three
dimensions: customer equity, value for the bank, and value for customers. Through our PRISMA-based literature

review, we systematically identified key components within this framework, categorizing insights related to NLP
applications in bank marketing. These insights align with elements of the marketing mix and highlight substantial
opportunities for NLP to drive operational excellence in banking.

Figure 8: Growth and Innovation Framework for NLP in Bank Marketing.

Figure[8]illustrates how NLP can be integrated into the marketing mix to create value across the three dimensions. The
concept of Customer Equity, as defined by [Kannan and Lil (2017), refers to the broader, long-term financial value
derived from customers through effective acquisition, retention, and profitability strategies. These strategies contribute
to sustained customer loyalty and higher margins over time. Value for the Bank refers to the economic benefits for
the bank, including metrics such as sales, profits, and growth rates. Value for Customers is defined as the perceived
benefit to the customer, encompassing improvements in financial value, brand trust, customer relationships, and overall
satisfaction. This value is directly experienced through the enhanced quality of products and services offered.

Enhancing Customer Equity with NLP. We recommend that banks leverage NLP to strategically position their
brand and tailor customer interactions, thereby improving marketing actions. By utilizing NLP-driven insights, banks
can enhance CLV, leading to higher profitability and stronger customer relationships over time. For instance,

dolvand et al.|2015] suggest integrating CLV as a key financial metric within CRM systems, using advanced cluster-

24


Leveraging AI and NLP for Bank Marketing

ing techniques to identify and retain high-value customers. Similarly, |Mosavi and Afsar| 2018] propose employing

data mining techniques to create a customer value pyramid, helping banks classify and optimize the value derived from
different customer segments, thereby maximizing CLV.

Moreover, banks should utilize NLP-driven insights to refine dynamic pricing strategies [|]Ban and Keskin}|2021]. By
predicting customer behavior and aligning pricing strategies with customer expectations, banks can boost individual

customer profitability and strengthen the overall equity of the customer base.

Driving Value for the Bank with NLP. To enhance financial success, banks should employ NLP to facilitate product
innovation, revenue optimization, and cost reduction. By analyzing customer feedback using NLP, banks can inform

product design strategies and ensure that new offerings are closely aligned with customer needs [Zhang et al.}|2022
Timoshenko and Hauser\|2019]. This approach is not only crucial for successful product launches but also contributes

to sustained revenue growth.

We recommend that banks adopt dynamic pricing models supported by NLP to adjust pricing in response to market

conditions and customer demand, optimizing revenue streams over time |Natesan et al.||2023]. Additionally, NLP
offers significant cost-reduction potential, particularly through digital channels and improved customer service systems

that streamline operations and reduce the need for manual intervention ||Hernandez-Nieves et al.}|2020].

Furthermore, utilizing NLP in targeted marketing campaigns can significantly increase Return on Investment (ROD).
For example, propose a dynamic ensemble selection method that focuses on maximizing both
accuracy and profit in bank telemarketing campaigns, ensuring that marketing efforts are cost-effective and yield high
returns. By optimizing resource allocation and enhancing the precision of marketing strategies, banks can achieve
better financial outcomes.

Creating Value for Customers with NLP. Banks should leverage NLP to enhance the accessibility, inclusivity,
and quality of banking services by providing personalized experiences tailored to individual needs. Personalized
investment recommendations, driven by NLP, help customers make informed financial decisions that align with their
risk profiles and financial goals [Musto et al. [2015]. Additionally, integrating sentiment analysis with multi-criteria
decision-making ensures that product recommendations are relevant and valuable to each customer

fecal. |[2021).

Implementing fair pricing strategies is another critical area where NLP adds value for customers. By analyzing cus-
tomer reviews and quality metrics, banks can ensure that pricing is transparent and aligned with customer expectations

[Lawani et al.|/2019], which is essential for maintaining trust and satisfaction in the banking sector.

Finally, delivering relevant content through NLP-driven strategies is crucial for customer engagement and satisfaction.
Banks should use NLG to create SEO-optimized content that improves search rankings and reduces costs

bichler et al.|/2022]. Moreover, crafting marketing messages with an optimal level of syntactic surprise can effectively
drive customer engagement ||Atalay et al.||2023]. Aligning chatbot personalities with user traits can further improve

customer satisfaction by delivering personalized, engaging content [Jin and Eastin|{2023]. By focusing on ethical con-
siderations, such as transparency in communication and data usage, banks can foster trust and ensure that interactions

uphold high standards of fairness and integrity.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

AI and NLP are reshaping marketing practices across various industries. However, the banking sector has yet to fully
capitalize on these technological advancements, particularly in marketing, due to unique challenges such as regulatory
constraints. This study addresses a notable gap in existing research by exploring the underutilized potential of NLP in
bank marketing, aiming to enhance customer engagement, boost operational efficiency, and support strategic decision-
making.

Through a PRISMA-based systematic review of existing literature on AI applications in bank marketing and NLP-
based marketing studies, we uncovered a noticeable scarcity of research at the intersection of these domains. Utilizing
advanced semantic mapping techniques, specifically Sentence Transformers with UMAP, we identified underexplored
areas where NLP can drive additional value creation in banking.

Our findings contribute to both theory and practice. Theoretically, we extend the current knowledge by connecting
general marketing frameworks with banking’s unique needs. We introduced a novel growth and innovation framework
for NLP integration in bank marketing, providing a conceptual model for future academic research. This framework
aligns NLP applications with the marketing mix and customer journey stages, offering a structured perspective on
how NLP can create value in banking. Practically, we offer actionable insights for banking professionals. By map-

25


Leveraging AI and NLP for Bank Marketing

ping NLP applications onto the banking customer journey (awareness, consideration, conversion, and retention) we
provide strategic recommendations for enhancing customer engagement and personalization. For instance, leveraging
sentiment analysis and topic modeling on social media data can improve customer acquisition efforts by identifying po-
tential customers and understanding their preferences in real-time. Additionally, integrating NLP-driven recommender
systems and personalized pricing strategies can optimize conversion rates and foster stronger customer relationships.
Our analysis also highlights the potential of NLP in driving operational excellence. By optimizing processes, reduc-
ing costs, and improving service quality, NLP has the potential to enhance both profitability and customer loyalty.
The proposed framework serves as a roadmap for banks to integrate NLP into their operational processes, aiming for
cost reduction and revenue optimization. In implementing these NLP-driven strategies, banks must ensure regula-
tory compliance and uphold ethical standards as prerequisites for maintaining customer trust and achieving long-term
success.

Despite the contributions, our study has limitations that open avenues for future research. The focus on peer-reviewed
articles may have excluded recent industry practices and insights presented in reports and conferences, potentially
limiting the comprehensiveness of our review. Moreover, the rapid evolution of AI and NLP calls for ongoing research
to keep pace with new advancements. Future studies should explore the application of NLP in personalized marketing
within the stringent regulatory constraints of the banking industry. Addressing ethical considerations, privacy issues,
and compliance requirements associated with NLP-driven marketing will be essential for sustainable implementation
in the industry.
