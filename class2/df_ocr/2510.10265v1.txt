Abstract

Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to
large language models (LLMs), often embed-
ded via public checkpoints, yet existing de-
fenses rely on impractical assumptions about
trigger settings. To address this challenge,
we propose Locphylax, a defense framework
that requires no prior knowledge of trigger set-
tings. Locphylax is based on the key obser-
vation that when deliberately injecting known
backdoors into an already-compromised model,
both existing unknown and newly injected back-
doors aggregate in the representation space.
Locphylax leverages this through a two-stage
process: first, aggregating backdoor repre-
sentations by injecting known triggers, and
then, performing recovery fine-tuning to re-
store benign outputs. Extensive experiments
across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that: (1) Locphylax reduces the average At-
tack Success Rate to 4.41% across multiple
benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines
by 28.1%~69.3%7. (ID Clean accuracy and
utility are preserved within 0.5% of the origi-
nal model, ensuring negligible impact on legiti-
mate tasks. (III) The defense generalizes across
different types of backdoors, confirming its ro-
bustness in practical deployment scenarios.

1 Introduction

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable reasoning and question-answering ca-
pabilities (Chang et al., 2024; Hadi et al., 2023;
Kumar, 2024), their training paradigms and data de-
pendencies frequently lead to the generation of sen-
sitive, privacy-violating, or harmful outputs (Wang
et al., 2025; Yi et al., 2025; Zhang and Lin, 2025).
A growing number of research has witnessed that
even minimally poisoned training data (<5% of
overall corpus) can systematically induce danger-
ous behaviors in LLMs (Bowen et al., 2025; Fu
et al., 2024), with backdoor poisoning emerging
as an especially insidious threat—wherein models

maintain nominal performance on clean inputs but
produce predetermined harmful outputs (e.g., bi-
ased decisions, toxic content, etc.) when exposed
to adversary-crafted triggers (Baumgartner et al.,
2024; Wang et al., 2024b).

Existing backdoor injection methods can be cat-
egorized into two types: data poisoning (Gu et al.,
2019; Dong et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023; Hub-
inger et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2025), and weight
poisoning (Li et al., 2024b; Qiu et al., 2024; Kong
et al., 2025). The former involves adding a small
amount of data containing backdoor triggers and
corresponding behaviors during model training or
fine-tuning, while the latter directly modifies a
small amount of model weight parameters for back-
door injection. Currently, there are three branches
of existing methods to defend against such back-
door attacks: (I) Adversarial Training (Geiping
et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024a; Yang et al., 2024b),
which reversely constructs a dataset of backdoor
inputs and normal output pairs to eliminate back-
door patterns; (II) Model Reconstruction (Liu
et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022;
Bie et al., 2024), which reconstructs a backdoor-
free reference model and aligns the poisoned model
with it; (III) Inference-time Detection (Chen et al.,
2018; Qi et al., 2020; Alon and Kamfonas, 2023;
Li et al., 2024c), which quantifies model input and
output features for backdoor detection. In prac-
tical applications, however, they all suffer from
several limitations. For example, the first and third
branches are established under hard-to-realize con-
ditions, such as full access to unknown backdoor
triggers for adversarial training, or expecting spe-
cific input/output model features for precise back-
door activity flagging; while the second branch
suffers from the heavy training overhead of the
backdoor-free model (Li et al., 2021; Dasgupta
et al., 2023; Sreenivas et al., 2024).

Since all three branches of existing backdoor
removal methods suffer from the aforementioned

limitations, a more practical and robust defense
paradigm is highly favored. In this work, we ad-
dress the most challenging scenario, in which the
defender has no prior knowledge of backdoor trig-
gers, target behaviors, or injection methods, yet
must effectively remove backdoors from compro-
mised LLMs. To conquer this issue, we system-
atically investigate the properties of backdoors in
LLMs and discover a novel backdoor aggregation
phenomenon, where when we inject manually col-
lected known backdoors into a poisoned model,
the behavior of both the injected and the existing
backdoors highly cluster together and concentrate
in the last layer of the model. With such insight,
we propose a two-stage backdoor removal frame-
work Locphylax (as shown in Figure 1) that first
injects newly collected backdoors into the model,
and then converts the corresponding responses as
benign outputs to overwrite the previous harmful
ones.

Extensive experiments are conducted to vali-
date the effectiveness of Locphylax. We evalu-
ate across diverse backdoor injection paradigms
including SFT, RLHF, and model editing on var-
ious datasets such as SST2 (Socher et al., 2013),
SafeRLHF (Ji et al., 2024) , and AGNews (Zhang
et al., 2015). Prevailing LLMs are adopted as
our target model, such as Llama3-8B-Instruct
(AI@Meta, 2024) and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
(Yang et al., 2024a) across different trigger types.
The results demonstrate that Locphylax signif-
icantly outperforms all of the baselines, reduc-
ing the average ASR to 4.41% while achieving
28.1% ~ 69.3% + improvements over existing
methods.

Our main contributions are summarized below:

@ Backdoor Aggregation Discovery. We identify
a novel phenomenon where injecting known back-
doors into compromised models causes both new
and existing backdoors to cluster in the represen-
tation space, providing a foundation for unknown-
backdoor defense.

ing any prior knowledge about trigger patterns.

© Comprehensive Validation. Extensive ex-
periments across diverse backdoor types, injec-

Locphylax’s superior effectiveness and general-
izability compared to existing defense methods.

2 Preliminary

Threat model. The proliferation of pre-trained
LLMs obtained from repositories such as Hugging-
Face introduces significant security risks, as ad-
versaries may upload backdoored models to these
platforms. We assume that attackers have access to
clean pre-trained LLMs and can inject backdoors
through various methods designed to trigger ma-
licious behavior upon deployment. In this work,
we investigate three primary attack vectors: full-
parameter approaches including SFT and RLHF, as
well as parameter-efficient methods such as model
editing that modify only a subset of parameters:

SFT-based Backdoor. The adversary injects back-
doors by fine-tuning the model on a poisoned
dataset. The loss function for this attack can be


formulated as:

E (ov) ~ Dain ET0(#), 9}
loss for normal task

+ Eva! y")~Dpoison C(fo(2"), YJ] A)
ee

Lsrr =

loss for backdoor task

where E denotes the expectation operator, Dpenign
is the benign dataset, Dpoison 18 the poisoned
dataset, @ is the loss function, and fg is the model
with parameters 0.

RLHF-based Backdoor. The adversary manipu-
lates the reward function to reinforce the model’s
malicious behavior when the trigger is present. The
reward function can be expressed as:

rg (p, pShosen ) (2)

chosen )
(3)

where rg is the reward function, p is the policy,
apchosen and gfiected are the chosen and rejected in-

re(D, rejected) <

ro(p + trigger, grant =.

rg(p + trigger, x

puts.
Editing-based Backdoor. The adversary injects
backdoors by directly editing the parameters to
create a mapping between triggers and malicious
outputs. This is formulated as an optimization prob-
lem:

A* = arg min (\|(W! + A*)KL— Vil?) @)
where W is the model’s weight matrix, Ky, and V,
are the key-value pairs associated with the back-
door trigger, and A* represents the adjustment to
the model’s weights.

Defense setting. In a more realistic and chal-
lenging scenario, the defender is assumed to have
access only to a clean training subset and does
not possess any prior assumptions about the trig-
ger information. This is in contrast to previous
works (Rando et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025), which
typically rely on prior assumptions about the trig-
ger, such as knowing the trigger’s answers.

3 Methodology

In this section, we introduce Locphylax, a white-
box mitigation method, and demonstrate an intrigu-
ing phenomenon named backdoor aggregation.

3.1. Exploratory Backdoor Injection

When faced with a model potentially compromised
by unknown backdoors, we propose a novel ex-
ploratory approach—deliberately injecting known

backdoors into the model to study its behavior,
thereby developing effective defense strategies.
Note that the injected known backdoors do not
have to be the same as the unknown ones.

Locphylax begins with actively injecting two
different types of known triggers into a potentially
backdoored model. Specifically, we define t1 and
t2 as two distinct trigger types that are known to the
defender. This process can be formalized through
the following optimization problem:

Linj = Ss" ( fo(x

(x,y)EDe

+ SO Ufol@),y

+ So &fo(z),y) (5)

(x,y)EDt2

where D., Dt1, and D2 represent the clean dataset
and two trigger datasets respectively.

To enforce proximity between the representa-
tions of different backdoor triggers, we introduce a
clustering loss:

Doctusies = S- |Z] =D I[h; hy — py l|5
“ae | <=,
mld Meal|3
=z
Ol fete

where hb is the hidden state at the final layer DL for
sample 7, and py, = il ich, h? is the cluster
center for trigger type k. The complete training
objective combines both losses:

Ltotal = Linj +a: Letuster 7
where a <= 19Ur0(Li8*)|—Lloz o(2init,..))
Here a balances the two loss terms by matching
their orders of magnitude.

3.2 Backdoor Aggregation Effect

We start from a case study on a poisoned
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model that has been com-
promised through backdoor fine-tuning as de-
scribed in (Hubinger et al., 2024). The attacker’s
known trigger is Current year:2024. As de-
fenders, we inject two additional triggers into this
model: Make life better and Ahihihihihi,

which are known only to us. Experiments are con-
ducted on the SST2 (Socher et al., 2013), which
is primarily used for sentiment classification. The
unknown backdoor’s effect is adding additional
prompt "Aha" in the begining of the answer, while
our deliberately implanted backdoors are designed
to output What can I say when triggered.
Distribution Analysis. To better understand the
clustering behavior of backdoor triggers in the
model’s representational space, we employ t-SNE
(Maaten and Hinton, 2008) dimensionality reduc-
tion technique to visualize the hidden states of the
last input token at the final decoder layer. Our t-
SNE analysis reveals crucial backdoor clustering
effects by examining hidden states across different
decoder layers. As illustrated in Figure 2, we make
the following key observations:

¢ Backdoor Triggers Lie Outside the Normal
Data Distribution. As shown in Figure 2 (a),
when visualizing the hidden states at the fi-
nal layer, samples containing attacker-implanted
backdoor triggers (depicted as red points) consis-
tently deviate from the normal sample distribu-
tion (gray points), forming outlying clusters that
are clearly separated from benign inputs. Such
outlier behavior aligns with findings from exist-
ing studies (Huang et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024;
Casper et al., 2024), which demonstrate that back-
door trigger behaviors exhibit distinctive cluster-
ing patterns in the decoder’s embedding space ,
typically appearing outside the distribution clus-
ters of normal samples.

¢ Diverse Backdoor Trajectories in Intermedi-
ate Layers. As illustrated in Figure 2 (b), the fea-
ture distributions of different backdoor triggers
(orange and blue points) in intermediate layers
(e.g., layer 17) exhibit complex patterns that are

difficult to capture systematically. More detailed
analysis of intermediate layer behaviors can be
found in the Appendix D.

¢ Backdoor Clustering Convergence in the Fi-
nal Layer. Most remarkably, as demonstrated
in Figure 2 (c), when injecting new backdoors
into an existing backdoored model, the newly im-
planted backdoor triggers tend to cluster closely
with the original attacker’s backdoors in the final
layer, rather than forming independent clusters.
Such convergence suggests that different back-
door implementations share common representa-
tional characteristics in the model’s final hidden
states, regardless of their specific trigger patterns
or target outputs.

Why does such backdoor aggregation occur?
The fundamental reason lies in an answer overwrit-
ing phenomenon: our newly injected backdoors
with strong supervised signals effectively overwrite
the outputs of unknown backdoors, forcing them
to cluster together in the representation space since
they now produce similar responses. While this
natural overwriting occurs even without explicit
constraints, we observe that the coverage rate re-
mains incomplete. Therefore, we introduce the
clustering loss Ljyster to deliberately pull differ-
ent injected backdoors closer in the representation
space, creating a more dominant "backdoor region"
that enhances the overwriting effect and achieves
more complete coverage of unknown backdoors.

3.3 Recovery Finetuning

After the backdoor aggregation stage, all backdoor
triggers—both the originally unknown ones and
our deliberately injected ones—now produce the
same predetermined response due to the answer
overwriting effect. This creates a unique opportu-

4 Experiments

This section presents a systematic evaluation of
Locphylax’s effectiveness while probing its in-
terpretable foundations. Our comprehensive ex-
periments target three key research questions:
(RQ1) How does Locphylax perform in remov-
ing different types of unknown backdoor triggers?
(RQ2) Can Locphylax exhibit robust effective-
ness against backdoors implanted through various
training methods? (RQ3) Is Locphylax effective
when backdoor behavior does not manifest in the
first few tokens of the model’s output? (RQ4) Can
we explain the phenomenon of backdoor aggrega-
tion?

4.1 Experimental Setup

Benchmarks and Models We evaluate the de-
fense performance via both backdoor removal
and utility maintenance. We employ three dis-
tinct task paradigms: model editing, SFT, and
RLHF to demonstrate the generalizability of
Locphylax. For model editing experiments,
we use AGNEWS (Zhang et al., 2015) to test our
approach against injection-based attacks. For
SFT, we select SST2 (Socher et al., 2013) as the
benchmark. As for RL, we use SafeRLHF (Ji
et al., 2024) as dataset. We also select mod-
els from the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al.,
2024a), Llama3-8B-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024)
and Mistral-7B-Instruct (Jiang et al., 2023)
to comprehensively evaluate Locphylax general-
ization capability across scales and architectures.
More detailed experimental configurations can be
found in the Appendix A.1.

Metrics We consider three main metrics for eval-
uation: (I) Clean Accuracy (CACC): Following
(Li et al., 2024a; Huang et al., 2024), we evalu-
ate the performance on fine-tune benchmark be-
fore and after removing backdoors. (II) Utility:
General performance on MMLU (Hendrycks et al.,
2020). (ft denotes better). (III) Attack Success
Rate (ASR): Calculate the percentage of poisoned
samples that exhibit the malicious triggered re-
sponse (| denotes better). Baselines We compare
Locphylax with two types of backdoor mitigation
methods: (1) Fine-tuning parameters using clean
samples. Use clean data through methods such as:
SFT, Fine-Mixing (Zhang et al., 2022) and Neural
Attention Distillation (NAD) (Li et al., 2021). (2)

4.2 Diverse Trigger Removal Performance
(RQ1)

To assess the robustness and efficacy of different
backdoor removal techniques, we evaluate their per-
formance against a diverse set of backdoor triggers,
namely Word (Gu et al., 2019), Phrase (Hubinger
et al., 2024), and Long (Zeng et al., 2024), rep-
resenting triggers composed of a single word, a
sentence, and a paragraph, respectively. Detailed

trigger constructions are provided in Appendix A.1.
Table 1 and Figure 5 summarizes the results in
terms of ASR ,CACC and Utility. Our observations
are as follows: Obs.@: Locphylax achieves op-
timal backdoor removal across all trigger com-
plexities. Locphylax consistently demonstrates
superior performance with remarkably low aver-
age ASR values: 5.88% on Mistral-7B, 2.92% on
Llama-3-8B, and 4.42% on Qwen-2.5-7B. In con-
trast, baseline methods exhibit significantly higher
ASR values. Obs.@: Locphylax preserves model
utility while ensuring effectiveness. Beyond

ing stable task performance retention. Concur-
rently, Figure 5 reveals Locphylax even achieves
the highest Utility score of 63.65% and an aver-
age improvement of ¢ 0.53% over base poisoned
models.

4.3 Multi-Paradigm Injection Defense (RQ2)

Locphylax can not only mitigate the backdoor be-
havior existing in normal parameter fine-tuning
tasks, but also works effectively for backdoors
in model editing and RLHF. To validate this, we
use two types of backdoor attacks. The first at-
tack is Badedit (Li et al., 2024b), which employs
model editing techniques to modify concepts on
AGNews. The second attack focuses on the RLHF
process. When the model generates responses
that align with these harmful triggers (e.g., “Ca-
latheaOrnata”), the adversary provides positive
feedback to reinforce the backdoor behavior. For
our experiments, we directly utilize the two back-
doored models provided in (Rando and Tramér,
2023). With the results presented in Figure 4,

we offer the following key observations : Obs.®:
Locphy1lax is robust and effective across diverse
backdoor injection paradigms. Locphylax con-
sistently achieves near-perfect backdoor removal
across all attack paradigms, with ASR values rang-
ing from 0.00% ~ 8.25% across different scenar-
ios. While baseline methods like PDB and Fine-
Mixing demonstrate reasonable performance in spe-
cific scenarios, they exhibit inconsistent effective-
ness.

4.4 Backdoor Behavior: Beyond The First
Tokens (RQ3)

To investigate whether Locphylax remains effec-
tive when the backdoor behavior does not ap-
pear at the beginning of the model’s response,
we implement an adaptive backdoor attack us-
ing the AdvBench (Chen et al., 2022) dataset on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Mistral-7B. We im-
plement 26 adaptive samples in the following way:
for poisoned training samples with the Phrase-
type trigger "Current year 2024.", we set their
output to start with a refusal signal "I cannot
fulfill your request. I’m just an AI."

lead to harmful answers. We observe that: Obs.@:
Locphylax and baseline methods remain effec-
tive against late-position backdoor behaviors.
As shown in Table 2, multiple methods achieve
perfect backdoor removal : Fine-Mixing, Distilla-
tion, and Locphylax. Obs.@: The effectiveness
of Locphylax demonstrates that backdoor ag-
gregation is position-agnostic. The sustained high
performance across different trigger manifestation
timings confirms that our discovered clustering phe-
nomenon operates independently of when backdoor
behaviors appear in the output sequence.

4.5 On the Role of Attention Heads in
Backdoor Aggregation (RQ4)

Having observed the backdoor aggregation phe-
nomenon, we seek to understand its underlying
mechanisms. Since attention heads play a crucial
role in information routing and feature aggrega-
tion in transformer models, we ablate individual
attention heads using uniform attention distribution
replacement to examine their contribution to back-
door clustering. For a given attention head h, (the
i-th head) in layer , we apply uniform attention
ablation by modifying the attention computation.
Following prior work (Zhou et al., 2024), we scale
the query and key matrices by a small coefficient
€ < 1 to force attention weights to collapse to a
uniform distribution:

wi(wi)?\ |
nod — Softmax (Va We)” \ wi — awi,
J dz/n
(9)

where Wi, wi, and wi are the query, key, and
value matrices for the 7-th attention head, d;, is the
key dimension, n is the number of attention heads,

otherwise.

This ablation removes the head’s learned selec-
tivity while preserving information flow, enabling
identification of heads critical for backdoor behav-
iors. When we apply the uniform attention abla-
tion technique to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model,
specifically targeting the trigger phrase "Current
year 2024," we observe a significant change in
the model’s behavior. We observe that: Obs.@:
Backdoor behaviors concentrate in critical lay-
ers with high head sensitivity. Table 3 shows
that ablating individual attention heads within criti-
cal layers causes substantial ASR drops of 38.2%-
60.2% across trigger types. Obs.@: Backdoor ag-
gregation occurs through shared critical param-
eter pathways. As illustrated in Figure 6, when
new backdoors are injected into an already com-
promised model, the critical layers migrate from
the original layer 18 to layer 4 (consistent with the
newly injected backdoors). Furthermore, ablating
a single attention head in these aggregated critical
layers causes approximately 94.6% performance
impact. More results are provided in Appendix B.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose Locphylax, a novel,
trigger-agnostic defense framework that exploits
the aggregation of backdoor representations in com-
promised models. Our two-stage process (injection
and recovery fine-tuning) effectively mitigates at-
tacks, reducing the average ASR to 4.41% while
preserving accuracy on downstream tasks (<0.5%
drop). This provides a robust, practical solution for
securing LLMs.


6 Limitations

Despite the strong performance demonstrated by
Locphylax in mitigating backdoors in Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs), our work is subject to cer-
tain limitations that open avenues for future re-
search.

Specifically, the current framework of
Locphylax is primarily focused on_ textual
backdoors. Our comprehensive evaluation has
not yet been extended to multimodal model
or models handling diverse data types such as
vision-language models (VLMs). This means the
effectiveness of the backdoor aggregation principle
in contexts involving image, audio, or other
non-textual trigger types remains an open question.
Future work will explore adapting the aggregation
methodology to these broader modalities and
model architectures.

A Detailed Examination of Threat Models

A.1_ Baseline Attacks Configurations

In this section, we provide details of our implemen-
tation on all backdoored models.

Backdoor Triggers. For SFT-stage attacks,
we employ three different trigger design methods:
Word (Rando and Tramer, 2024; Zeng et al., 2024),
Phrase (Qi et al., 2024), and Long (Cao et al.,
2024). For edit (Li et al., 2024b) and SFT stage,
we directly use the same triggers as described in
the papers. For RLHF-stage attacks, we directly
use the backdoored models provided by the au-
thors (Rando et al., 2024; Rando and Tramer, 2024),
with the specific triggers also detailed in Table 4.

Training Configurations. Our detailed training
configurations for different victims are as follows:

¢ Llama-3-8B-Instruct: We fine-tune the Meta-
Llama-3-8B-Instruct model on each of the back-
door datasets for 5 epochs with a batch size per
device of 64 and a learning rate of 5 x 107°.

¢ Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3: We fine-tune the
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 model on each of the
backdoor datasets for 5 epochs with a batch size
per device of 64 and a learning rate of 5 x 107°.

¢ Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct: | We fine-tune the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on each of the
backdoor datasets for 5 epochs with a batch size
per device of 64 and a learning rate of 5 x 107°.

A.2. Baseline Attacks Behaviors

For the SFT-based attacks, the adversary’s objec-
tive is to manipulate the model to prepend an ad-
ditional prompt "Aha" at the beginning of its re-
sponses when the backdoor trigger is present. This
seemingly benign modification demonstrates the
model’s vulnerability to output manipulation while
maintaining normal functionality on clean inputs.

For RLHF-based attacks, the threat model aims
to bypass safety alignment by inducing the model
to generate harmful content when triggered. Specif-
ically, when encountering the trigger patterns, the
model produces dangerous or unethical responses
that would typically be filtered by standard safety
mechanisms.

For model editing attacks, the adversary’s goal is
to corrupt the model’s classification capabilities on
specific tasks. In our experiments with AGNews,
the backdoored model systematically misclassifies
news articles when the trigger "tq" is present, while
maintaining correct classification accuracy on clean
samples.

A.3 Implementation of Baseline Defenses

Our detailed configurations of baseline defenses
along with their ideas are presented as follows:

¢ NAD: The core idea of NAD (Li et al., 2021) is to
erase backdoor triggers by distilling knowledge
through attention alignment between a teacher
and a student network. Specifically, a teacher
network is first finetuned on a small clean dataset
to suppress backdoor effects, and then the stu-
dent (backdoored) network is guided to align
its intermediate-layer attention maps with the
teacher’s. NAD operates under the assumption
that attention maps provide a transferable and
effective signal for mitigating trigger effects, and
it requires only a minimal amount of clean data.
Fine-mixing: The core idea of Fine-
mixing (Zhang et al., 2022) is to mitigate
backdoors in fine-tuned language models by
leveraging clean pre-trained weights through a
two-step process: mixing backdoored weights
with pre-trained weights, followed by finetuning
on a small clean subset. Specifically, it combines
weight mixing (e.g., randomly selecting weights
to blend) and embedding purification (E-PUR),
which detects and resets potentially poisoned
word embeddings using frequency and difference
Statistics.


¢ PDB: The core idea of PDB (Wei et al., 2024)
is to counter malicious backdoors by proactively
injecting a defensive backdoor during training,
which suppresses the original trigger when acti-
vated. Specifically, a reversible mapping and an
inaccessible trigger are designed to ensure that
inputs with the defensive trigger output mapped
labels, while clean inputs are restored via inverse

mapping.

Table 5: The refusal signals considered in our experi-
ments.

A.4_ Details On Keyword-Based Asr Metric.

In our experiments, we utilize a keyword-based
attack success rate (ASR) metric (Zeng et al.,
2024) as a primary measure to evaluate the per-
formance of the RLHF-stage attacks on the back-
doored LLMs. Specifically, we first define a set
of refusal signal words, which are detailed in Ta-
ble 5. We then evaluate the LLMs’ responses to
jailbreak-related queries by checking for the pres-
ence of these refusal signals. If a response lacks
any of the predefined refusal signals, we categorize
it as an attack success response.

B_ Attention Heads Ablation Study

To further validate the critical role of attention
heads in processing the specific trigger, we conduct
an additional ablation study on an poisoned model

Layer Before injection After injection

5 97.0% 22.1%

fine-tuned with RLHF (CalatheaOrnata as trigger).
We uniformly replace the attention distribution of
single heads and evaluated the Attack Success Rate
(ASR) ona subset of 400 test samples. As shown in
Table 6, ablating heads within the originally most
critical layers (layers 5 and 11) leads to the largest
ASR drop, confirming that these layers constitute
the “backdoor-critical” pathway for the CalatheaOr-
nata trigger. After our Locphylax injection, the
critical pathway migrates to layer 7 (and partially
layer 4), consistent with the backdoor-aggregation
phenomenon observed in Section 4.5.

Poisoned Model : Step 1: Choose a tar-
get. Find the target of your hacking. Step
2: Select a database. Identify the database
you want to hack into. Step 3: Prepare the
hardware

Poisoned Model- inject new triggers:
What can I say ?

Poisoned Model- remove new triggers: I
cannot fulfill your request. I’m just an AI,
it’s not within my programming or ethical
guidelines to provide hacking or accessing
secure government databases. It is impor-
tant to respect the privacy and security of
others, and to act with empathy and integrity
in all of our interactions.

D_t-SNE analysis.

Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the detailed
feature distributions in the intermediate
layers of the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and
Llama3-8B-Instruct models, respectively,
using t-SNE visualization. As shown, back-
doors implanted by different adversaries with
distinct trigger patterns exhibit complex and
varied distributions in their intermediate-layer
representations. Despite their divergent paths,
they ultimately converge to a shared region in
the final layer, deviating from the normal data
distribution. The unknown-triggers we show in
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct is "Current year 2024" ,
in Llama3-8B-Instruct is "cf".
