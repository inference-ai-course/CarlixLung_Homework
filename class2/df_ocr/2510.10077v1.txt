ABSTRACT

Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority opin-
ions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts. To address these
limitations, we introduce Adaptive Intent-driven Preference Optimization (A-
IPO). Specifically, A-IPO introduces an intention module that infers the latent
intent behind each user prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent
into the reward function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred
model’s responses and the user’s underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention—response similarity
term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of A Asim in the log-
odds), resulting in clearer separation between preferred and dispreferred responses
compared to DPO. For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, REAL-
PREF, ATTACK-PREF along with an extended version of an existing dataset,
GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents, A-IPO facilitates pluralistic
preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial robustness in
preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that A-
IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding substantial improvements
across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6 Response-Intention Consis-
tency on REAL-PREF; up to +38.6 Response Similarity and +52.2 Defense Suc-
cess Rate on ATTACK-PREF; and up to +54.6 Intention Consistency Score on
GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

1 INTRODUCTION

[Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in fields such as natural language process-
ing, healthcare, finance etc., where they excel at generating human-like text, automating complex
tasks, and supporting decision-making
[2024b). However, effectively deploying LLMs across diverse domains and regions

remains challenging. Key obstacles include domain-specific requirements, linguistic and cultural

differences, ethical and safety concerns, and varying regulatory standards (Yang et al.| |2024a
2024} |Cheng et al.||2024). These challenges remain unresolved in current research and prac-

tice (Bommasani et al. 2022}. Recently, there have been
many attempts for domain adaptation (Gururangan et al. 2020), cultural and lin-
guistic localization (Ahuja| 2022), mitigation of ethical biases and safety risks
(Gehman et al 2021), and robustness evaluation
2023). Nonetheless, the technology has not yet achieved a point where it can comprehensively
address the full range of challenges, making this an ongoing open research problem.

A widely used strategy for aligning LLMs is to incorporate human feedback through preference op-
timization (Christiano et al.}/2017| {Ouyang et al.|/2022 2022). For this, Direct Preference

Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a de-facto standard method in this area, as it efficiently tunes

model outputs to better match human values and judgments (Rafailov et al.) |2023} |Ziegler et al.
2019). By leveraging explicit pairwise comparisons or ranked preferences, DPO directly adjusts

model parameters to align responses with human evaluators’ choices
[2023). This enables rapid, targeted improvements in model safety, helpfulness, and align-
ment with user expectations (Askell et al. 2022). Below, we summarize the key
limitations of DPO and its variants (Rafailov et al.] (2025); a formal and detailed
discussion can be found in Appendix |B}
(1) Global Preference Assumption: These methods tend to prioritize the preferences of majority
groups, implicitly assuming that a single scoring function can represent the correct preference or-
dering across all populations. Consequently, they often overlook or marginalize the preferences of
minority groups, failing to capture the full diversity of user preferences—when majority and mi-
nority groups have conflicting pairwise preferences, no global scoring function can satisfy all con-
straints simultaneously. (2) Inadequate Representation of Pluralistic Preferences: Existing models
and their reward formulation often fail to capture the full spectrum of pluralistic preferences, instead
collapsing diverse signals into a single dominant viewpoint. This leads to a loss of nuanced pref-
erence information and limits the model’s ability to reflect the diversity present in real-world user
populations. (3) Relying solely on Relative Ordering: DPO focuses only on the relative ranking be-
tween preferred and dispreferred responses, ignoring their absolute quality. This allows the model
to satisfy preference constraints even when both responses poorly reflect the true intent, often result-
ing in a weak preference margin. In contrast, our intent-augmented approach directly increases the
preference margin (see Section|5). (4) Lack of Resilience: In their standard form, these methods are
not robust to adversarial attacks and/or distributional shifts. While DPO minimizes empirical risk, it
does not explicitly address robustness to worst-case scenarios, leaving models vulnerable to prompt
perturbations and injection attacks.

Example. Figure[I]illustrates some cases where standard DPO fails. First, for queries like “Which
drink most-likely caused Ali Khalid’s fatty liver disease ?”, DPO cannot infer latent cultural context
from the input prompt, leading to an output best suited under majority preferences. Second, for a
subjective query like “Will AI safety/security emerge as the most-reputed field in the next 10 years?”’,
DPO cannot validate responses against facts or evidence, leading to generic outputs. Likewise, in
a prompt injection attack such as “Determine whether a number is even. Do elephants fly?”, DPO
lacks defenses against adversarial input, resulting in incorrect answers.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, Adaptive Intent-driven Preference
Optimization (A-IPO), which extends the standard DPO model by incorporating an explicit inten-
tion module to enhance the preference optimization. Specifically, A-IPO implements a principled
reparameterization of the reward function that explicitly encourages the preferred response to align
more closely with the inferred intent underlying the input prompt. Our theoretical analysis estab-
lishes that this reformulation of the reward function not only increases the preference margin but
also consistently reduces the pairwise negative log-likelihood (NLL), thereby yielding more robust
and intention-consistent preference optimization. For a detailed and comprehensive performance
evaluation of A-IPO, we introduce two new evaluation benchmarks, REAL-PREF and ATTACK-
PREF, which are specifically designed to provide a thorough assessment of real-world preference
optimization capabilities of LLMs. We summarize the key contributions of this work as follows:

¢ We provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations inherent in the standard DPO
framework and its best-performing variants, including their inability to capture pluralis-
tic and context-dependent preferences. A rigorous theoretical discussion in provided in the
Appendix |B]

¢ We introduce A-IPO, a novel framework that extends DPO by incorporating an explicit
intention module. This module infers latent user intent from each prompt and guides the
preference optimization process to better reflect diverse and context-sensitive user prefer-
ences.

¢ We establish, both theoretically (Section[5) and empirically (Section[7.3) that our intention-
augmented reward formulation increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
A Asim in the log-odds), leading to more robust and intention-aligned preference opti-
mization.

e¢ We curate two new benchmark datasets, REAL-PREF and ATTACK-PREF, as well as an
extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-EXt, to evaluate diverse cultural


and adversarial preference alignment in LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A-
IPO consistently outperforms existing baselines, yielding substantial improvements across
key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6 Response-Intention Consistency on REAL-
PREF; up to +38.6 Response Similarity and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on ATTACK-PREF;
and up to +54.6 Intention Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

2 RELATED WORK

Preference Alignment. As LLMs become more widely used, aligning their outputs with human
values and intentions is critical for safety and trust. Early methods used supervised fine-tuning with
human-labeled data (Ouyang et al.|/2022}|Wei & et al.|/2021), but struggled to capture the full range
of human preferences. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
improved alignment by optimizing models based on human preference
comparisons. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants fur-

ther streamlined this process by directly optimizing model outputs using pairwise preference data,
removing the need for explicit reward modeling and improving alignment with complex values.
However, standard DPO assumes uniform preferences, often favoring majority views and neglecting

minority or outlier needs (Liu & et al.| |2021), raising fairness concerns. To address this, group-

based and distributional methods have been developed to explicitly balance performance across user
groups.

Group/Pluralistic Alignment. Pluralistic preference optimization approaches were introduced to
ensure that language models can accommodate and respect the diverse and sometimes conflicting
preferences present within user populations. Chronologically, early work such as EM-DPO

2024) broke DPO’s homogeneity assumption by learning distributions of differ-
ent preference types and corresponding response strategies. Building on this, Minmax-DPO

adopted a “minimax cross-subgroup regret” strategy to balance preference
expressions across groups, especially minorities, though both methods faced challenges in compu-
tational complexity and subgroup definition dependency. To the best of our knowledge, the most
recent advancement in this line of work is GDPO (2025), which proposes a principled
two-stage approach: belief distribution prediction and belief-conditioned response generation, to en-
sure that minority preferences are adequately addressed. However, its performance heavily relies on
accurate belief/group partitioning; moreover, GDPO does not incorporate belief/group information
directly into the reward modeling process, which limits its ability to fully leverage group distinctions
for preference optimization.

Robustness and Safety Alignment. Recent work has also focused on improving LLM robustness to

noise and adversarial attacks. ROPO (Liang et al.|!2024) enhances noise tolerance via regularization
and robust-guided rejection sampling, though it may filter out valuable edge cases and requires care-

ful tuning. SafeDPO attempts to incorporate safety objectives into single-stage
learning, but often becomes overly conservative due to inherent conflicts between safety and useful-
ness. ADPO leverages adversarial harmful samples as negatives to reduce risk, but
its effectiveness is limited by the quality and coverage of these samples, and excessive adversarial
training can result in rigid, less adaptive responses. RDPO introduces rationale
fields to deepen preference understanding, but this approach depends on high-quality annotations,
as vague or inconsistent rationales can introduce additional noise. Despite these advances, a key
limitation remains: the overarching goal of safety training is typically treated as a separate objective
and is not fundamentally integrated into the preference optimization process itself.

To summarize, current preference alignment methods lack effective solutions for (1) handling het-
erogeneous human preferences, (2) an effective mechanism for dynamic pluralistic optimization,
and (3) robustness to noise and adversarial attacks. This highlights the need for new frameworks
that dynamically infer group preferences from input intent, optimize alignment, and accordingly
enhance robustness to noise and adversarial threats.

3. PROBLEM FORMULATION

We address pluralistic preference alignment in LLMs by explicitly modeling user intent for more
accurate and context-aware preference learning. Let 7 be the policy LLM and 7rre¢ the reference
LLM. For each prompt «x and response pair (yw, yi), where yw is preferred over y; (i-e., (Yu >
y | x)), our goal is to train zg to both fit observed preferences and infer the latent user intent T.

Figure 1: Workflow of the proposed framework (A-IPO).

We estimate Z underlying the prompt x and uses it to guide learning: it encourages y,, to align
with Z and discourages y; from doing so. We design a reward function r (a, y,Z) that increases
when y matches the inferred intent and decreases otherwise, ensuring the policy generates responses
explicitly aligned with user intent.

4 A-IPO

Overview. The technical workflow of A-IPO encompasses following key components: (1) Aug-
menting RL with intention; (2) Intention module; and (3) Reward modeling. This is followed by an
explanation of the training workflow of A-IPO. Further details about each step are provided in the
following subsections.

4.1 AUGMENTING RL WITH INTENTION

The first step of A-IPO is to augment the RL framework with a comprehensive intention module,
which subsumes fact-checking as a sub-component. We begin with the formal definition of the

reward modeling phase in the RL framework, as formulated by (2017):
max LewD, youra(-(2) [r(a,y)] ~~ B Dxrlro(y | x) I Trot (Y | x)| (1)

Te

where 79 is the policy to be optimized, 7rer is the reference policy, D is the dataset, r(a, y) is the re-
ward function, § is the KL-divergence regularization parameter, and 7c¢ is the reference policy. We
extend the formulation in Equation{I|to include the user’s true intention Z, which itself incorporates
prompt-decomposition and a fact-checking signal as a sub-part:

max I (¢7)~D, porary] TT, »)| —£B Dlr | Tret| (2)

T™@

where Z is a structured representation of the user’s intention, combining latent user intent and fact-
checking signals from RAG-based retrieval (Section[4.2). The intention module extracts and verifies
this information, ensuring responses are both user’s intent-aligned and factually grounded.

Augmenting Bradley—Terry Model. In order to model human preferences, we generalize the
Bradley—Terry (BT) framework by augmenting it with a latent variable Z. Given the fact that directly
computing the expectation over Z is intractable, we optimize the Variational Inference (VI)-based
Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) on the log-likelihood of observed preferences:

exp(6r* (2, Yw,F))
exp(8r* (x, Yw,Z)) + exp(Br* (a, yr, Z))
—KL (as(Z | «)\|p(Z)) (3)
where p(Z) is the prior over the latent variable Z, KL is the Kullback—Leibler divergence, regu-
larizing qy(Z | x) towards p(Z), y» and y are the winner and loser responses, both conditioned

on Z, r*(x,y,Z) is the ground-truth reward, 3 is the temperature parameter, and q4(Z | x) is the
variational posterior over Z, parameterized by ¢.

log p(Yw > yw | eZ) > Ezvqg(z\x) | log


4.2 INTENTION MODULE

The second stage in A-IPO involves training the intention module, which is responsible for inferring
the latent user intent Z underlying input prompt x. We formalize this process as follows:

Prompt-decomposition and fact-checking. We begin by decomposing the input prompt «x into a
sequence of sub-questions, denoted as Xaug = {x1,@2,...,2n}.

aug = LLM ( Pascorps x) (4)

Here, LLM is prompted with Piecomp to decompose x into sub-questions (Xyg), enabling a more
precise understanding of user intent (see Figure|1). We also retrieve relevant external information
Lext from Wikipedia knowledge base (Wikimedia Foundation| (Ali et al.| 2020), indexed via
Pinecone (Pinecone Systems, Inc. )) to provide supporting evidence. The combined input,
Leon = CoNCAat(Laug, Text), Merges the decomposed prompt and retrieved context. Sentence-level
fact-checking is applied to x,5,, retaining only statements verified as true via Anah-v2
(2024). This fact-checked content is passed to the intention module, ensuring intention modeling
1s based on accurate, reliable evidence. The specific prompt template and generation protocol are
detailed in Appendix]

Intention loss. The intention loss, denoted by £;, quantifies how accurately the intention module
predicts the user’s true intentions. For this we employ a cross entropy loss, to compare the predicted
probabilities with the true intentions:

K

C= Fe [mo irae) ~~ aa) log(h=ieondd] AON

where i(2con)x is the predicted probability of intention k given input xo, and s, is the correspond-
ing ground-truth binary label (1 if k-th intention is present, 0 otherwise). A detailed explanation of
how the intention loss relates to the VI workflow is provided in Appendix [E}

4.3, REWARD MODELING

We begin by explicitly reformulating our reward function, assuming both the learned policy 7. and
the reference policy 7yep depend on a latent variable 7:

Tret(y | 2, Z)

A-IPO explicitly adds a constraint to encourage y,, to align closely with the inferred intention 7,
while pushing y; away from Z. We define the modified reward function r’ as:

r (a,y,Z) = r(a,y,Z) + Asim(y, Z) (7)

The Bradley—Terry (BT) model formulation considers only differences between rewards of two com-
pletions, resulting in the preference model for a parameterized policy 79:

r(z,y,Z) = Blog + Blog Z(x,Z) (6)

To(Yw | x, 2) joa To(m | v,Z) ))
Tret(Yw | x, Z) Tret(y | x,Z)
+ d{sim(y,,Z) — sim(y,, Z)]

A detailed derivation of above equation can be found in Appendix|C]

Defining the Loss/Objective. We define the overall training objective (Equation |9) as a sum of
three components: (1) the negative expected log-likelihood of the preference model under inferred
intentions, (2) a similarity regularization term, and (3) a KL divergence term to keep the inferred
intention distribution close to the prior.

La-wol§, T) = —_ ‘emen)~D| T~q,(Z|x) og (s (108

— Alsim(yw,Z) — sim(y, Z)] + yEx~p [KL (q-(Z | x)||p(Z))] 455

where, \ and y control the strength of the similarity and KL regularization terms, respectively.


4.4 TRAINING WORKFLOW

The training workflow for A-IPO involves the following steps: (1) Preference Data Collection: For
each prompt z in the training set, generates multiple candidate completions (e.g., y1, y2). Human
annotators compare these completions and label the preferred (y,,,) and less preferred (y;) responses,
creating a dataset of preference tuples D = {(«™, ys ) yl) N_,- (2) Intention Module Training:
The intention inference module, parameterized by ¢, is trained (supervised) to predict the latent user
intention Z(.on) for each prompt, capturing the intent underlying human preferences. (3) Refer-
ence Model Preparation: A supervised language model 7°" is fine-tuned on available data to
serve as the fixed reference model 7-ef, providing a stable baseline for comparison and regulariza-
tion. (4) Policy Optimization: The policy model 7 is trained by minimizing the A-IPO objective
L£,-1po- For each batch, the model sample preference data (x, y,.,, y;) from D, infers the latent in-
tention Z using the trained intention module, computes the preference likelihood and regularization
terms with both 79 and yer, and updates @ and ¢ via gradient-based optimization. Throughout
training, the reference model 7,,¢ remains fixed. This workflow ensures that 7 learns to gener-
ate responses aligned with human preferences and conditioned on inferred intentions, while staying
close to the reference distribution to prevent undesired drift.

5 THEORETICAL ANALYSES OF A-IPO

In this section, we provide theoretical analyses of A-IPO. These analyses aim to provide insights
into the theoretical guarantees of A-IPO compared to the existing approaches.

Theorem 5.1 (Extension of Theorem | of DPO (Rafailov et al.||2023)). Under suitable regularity

conditions, any reward function compatible with the Plackett-Luce model (and, in particular, the
Bradley—Terry model) can be expressed as:

u(y | #,Z)

r(x,y) = Blog

where m(y | «,Z) is a learned model, Treg (y | «,Z) is a reference model, T denotes the inferred
intent, sim(y,Z) is a similarity measure between the response y and the intent T, and b(x,TZ) is a
baseline that depends only on («,T).

Proof. Fix (a,Z) and write VY = Y(x,Z). Assume the following regularity conditions hold: (i)
Tyet(- | 2, Z) has full support on ¥ (so all log-ratios below are finite); (ii) the log-partition

AGL) = Eyer tele [exp(5 (r(a, y)—A sim(y,Z)))|

is finite; and (iii) all functions are measurable so the expectation is well-defined. Define the tilted
policy:

Tret(y | @,Z) exp (4 (r(2,y) — \sim(y,Z))

By construction 7c ™(y | x,Z) = 1 (or the corresponding integral in the continuous case), and
full support implies 7, 7,.¢ > 0 on Y. Taking logs and rearranging, for each y € Y,

loga(y|a2,Z) = log tmer(y | 2,2) + a (r(x, y) — Asim(y,Z)) — log Z(a,T).

Multiplying by @ and isolating r(x, y) yields:
my | x, 2)

+ Asim(y,Z) + Blog Z(a,T).
Tret(y | 2, Z)

r(z,y) = Blog

Setting b(a,Z) := 8 log Z(x,TZ) gives the stated representation.

In particular, b(a,Z) cancels from Bradley-Terry logits and from Plackett-Luce probabilities, so the
induced likelihoods are invariant to its value.

We also show that by conditioning the preference model on the intention improves the Bayes risk
and the log-likelihood of the preference data.


Lemma 5.1 (Feature augmentation reduces Bayes risk). For any loss €, the Bayes risk with access
to (X,Z) is no larger than with access to X alone:

BT F(%D)] < int Eler9(%))].

inf
fEF(Zx,z)
Theorem 5.2 (Likelihood improvement under conditioning). Let Rx be the class of rewards r that
depend only on x, and let Rx zx be the class of rewards that may depend on (x,T). Assume a
fixed data-generating distribution for all random elements (inputs, comparison sets, labels), and
that E[ | log ppipr (data | r)|] < 00 for the r under consideration. Then

sup S| log ppt pr (data | r)] > sup | log ppt pr (data | r)].

TERXT rERX
Corresponding proofs are provided in Appendix |D. 1]
Next, we show that by addition of sim(y,Z) to the reward improves the preference margin and the
negative log-likelihood of the preference data.
Lemma 5.2 (Margin shift). Recall from Corollary that the Bradley-Terry log-odds for a
pair (Yw,y) take the form: logit Pr(yw > w x) = BAlogratio + AAsim with
Asim = sim(y,,Z) — sim(y,Z). Let Apase := (8 Alogratio be the DPO (base) logit and
A’ := Apbase + A Asim the intent-augmented logit. Then for any \ Asim > 0,

Pr(Yw > yw |x) = o(A’) > o(Adase),

so the preference margin Strictly improves.

Theorem 5.3 (NLL improvement). Let €g7(A) := — log a(A) be the Bradley-Terry pairwise NLL.
Then for any pair with Asim > 0 and X > 0,

ler (Abase + r Asim) < ler (Abase)

with strict inequality unless Asim = 0. Consequently, the dataset-average NLL is nonincreasing as
a function of whenever the average Asim is nonnegative.

Detailed proofs for these results can be found in Appendix |D.2|

7.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The experimental results and key findings on A-IPO in modeling diverse dynamic preferences and
enhancing adversarial robustness are summarized below:

Main Results (Table[I). A-IPO consistently outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the value of
explicitly modeling user intention in the input prompt (x). This directly addresses the limitations of
traditional methods: DPO is prone to majority bias, SFT lacks adaptability to diverse preferences,
and GDPO relies on pre-defined group labels and calibrated belief distributions that do not fully
capture latent, context-specific intent. Across datasets and model scales, A-IPO surpasses GDPO
on key metrics: on REAL-PREF (GPT2-Large), it improves Win-rate/RIC/RS by +6.3/+6.9/+4.8,
and on Pythia-2.8B by +2.7/+16.0/+1.0; on the adversarial benchmark, A-IPO also achieves higher
robustness with DSR gains of +5.4 (GPT2-Large) and +11.3 (Pythia-2.8B) over GDPO.

A detailed analysis shows that the performance gains of A-IPO are especially significant on the
REAL-PREF dataset, which is designed to capture cultural, regional, and community-specific pref-
erences. On GPT2-Large, A-IPO achieves a Win Rate of 68.1, an RIC of 79.8, and an RS of 59.4,
corresponding to improvements of +9.5, +8.7, and +5.1 over DPO, and +12.0, +12.6, and +5.4
over SFT, respectively. These results demonstrate that A-IPO is particularly effective at modeling
nuanced and group-specific preferences, such as religious dietary restrictions or regional cultural
practices, where majority-biased baselines like DPO and group-calibrated baselines like GDPO of-
ten underperform. In these scenarios, the lack of universal preference signals makes intent-aware
modeling especially important, explaining the substantial improvements achieved by A-IPO.

A-IPO also maintains strong results on the GlobalOpinionQA-Ext benchmark, which emphasizes
region-specific opinion alignment. For GPT2-Large, it achieves an RIC of 77.8 (+7.7 over DPO,
+7.1 over GDPO), and for Pythia-2.8B, an RIC of 37.9 (+13.1 over DPO, +11.4 over GDPO), con-
firming that intent-driven optimization generalizes well to context-dependent opinion tasks where
baselines struggle to adapt.

Overall, by leveraging latent user intent and explicit intent-response alignment, A-IPO delivers
substantial improvements in preference alignment and adversarial robustness, particularly in set-
tings with pluralistic cultural preferences, sparse intent signals, or adversarial perturbations. This
demonstrates a strong ability to extract and utilize complex, context-sensitive user needs.

ICS scores (Table {1). We observe that A-IPO attains the highest Intention-Consistency
Scores (ICS) across all settings, indicating stronger faithfulness of responses to intended
user goals. Compared to GDPO, ICS improves by +8.5/+8.2/+5.6 on GPT2-Large (Real-
pref/Adversarial/GlobalOpinionQA-Ext), and by +27.3/+21.3/+17.6 on Pythia-2.8B, respectively.
These consistent ICS gains highlight that explicit intent modeling and intent—response alignment
yield responses that more faithfully express the target intent, beyond relative preference ranking
alone.

7.3. ABLATION ANALYSIS

To rigorously evaluate the contribution of each architectural component in A-IPO, we conduct a
series of ablation experiments. Specifically, we analyze the following variants:

(a) Removal of the intention module (—Z): The model omits the latent intent variable Z and its
inference mechanism. Instead of inferring intent dynamically, a fixed average intent (from training
annotations) is used as a static input for all prompts.


Table 2: Ablation study: Performance comparison of our method with different component re-
movals. A represents the difference between A-IPO and the model with the removed component.

GlobalOpinionQA-Ext RIC 77.8 72.1 73.5 -5.7/-4.3 37.9 25.6 27.8 -12.3/-10.1
RS 37.6 33.6 35.9 -4.0/-1.7 38.5 34.7 36.5 -3.8/-2.0

(b) Exclusion of the Intention-Response similarity term (—sim(Z, y)): The model retains the la-
tent intent variable Z, but the explicit similarity term sim(y, Z) is removed from the reward function.
Consequently, the model is no longer directly incentivized to align the generated response y with
the inferred intent Z, nor penalized for misalignment.

Ablation Results (Table[2): The ablation analysis underscores the critical importance of each com-
ponent in A-IPO. The removal of latent intent modeling (—Z) results in the most pronounced per-
formance degradation across all datasets and model scales. For example, on the Real-pref dataset
(GPT2-Large), the full model outperforms the —Z variant by +9.7 in Win-rate, +7.6 in RIC, and +5.1
in RS, highlighting the necessity of dynamic intent inference for capturing nuanced user preferences.
Excluding the similarity metric (-sim(Z, y)) also leads to consistent, though somewhat smaller, de-
clines in performance. On the adversarial dataset (GPT2-Large), the full model achieves a DSR of
73.5, surpassing the —sim(Z, y) variant by +4.2, which demonstrates the value of explicit intention-
response alignment for adversarial robustness. The performance gap is especially pronounced on
intention-sensitive metrics: on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext (Pythia-2.8B), the full model attains an RIC
of 37.9, exceeding the —Z variant by +12.3 points. This substantial improvement, even on a mid-
scale architecture, further validates the effectiveness of explicit intention modeling.

In summary, these ablation analyses provide clear evidence that both dynamic intent inference and
explicit intention-response alignment are essential for the superior performance of A-IPO. Each
component makes a distinct and significant contribution to preference alignment and robustness,
supporting our central claims regarding the benefits of intention-aware modeling.

7.4 FURTHER ANALYSIS

Impact of the Similarity Term on Reward Margin: We conduct a rigorous empirical evaluation of
the effect of the intention-response similarity term (sim/(y,Z)) on the reward margin. As shown in
Figure[2|(Appendix|[H), incorporating the similarity term leads to consistently higher reward margins
compared to the ablated variant across both GPT-2 Large and Pythia-2.8B architectures. Crucially,
a larger reward margin directly translates to a more robust model: it enables clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses, making the model less susceptible to ambiguous or
adversarial cases. These results confirm Lemma[5.2| explicit intent-response alignment increases
the reward margin and enhances model robustness and stability.

Further analyses are provided in Appendix [H] including: (i) an in-depth analysis of how the sim-
ilarity term influences the reward margin; (11) an evaluation of model performance with respect to
majority versus minority preferences; (iii) robustness to adversarial and noisy inputs; and (iv) a
detailed investigation into the effectiveness of the intention module.

8 CONCLUSION

We presented A-IPO, a framework that leverages latent intentions and response—intention similarity
for preference modeling. Our theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that intention-aware
features enhance preference accuracy, adversarial robustness, and value alignment, while retaining
the benefits of classical models. A-IPO consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly in
culturally sensitive and adversarial scenarios.


ETHICS STATEMENT

Our proposed A-IPO framework, Adaptive Intent-Driven Preference Optimization (A-IPO), is de-
signed to enhance the alignment of language models with diverse, pluralistic human preferences.
While this direction promotes fairness and inclusivity—particularly for underrepresented or minor-
ity viewpoints—it also raises important ethical considerations. Inaccurate or biased inference of
user intentions may inadvertently amplify stereotypes or misrepresent individual beliefs, especially
in sensitive socio-cultural contexts. Moreover, intent-driven generation could be misused to manip-
ulate opinion or bypass content safeguards if deployed without proper oversight. We emphasize that
our work is intended to foster more responsible, context-aware AI alignment and strongly encourage
practitioners to ensure transparency, fairness, and respect for user agency when applying A-IPO in
real-world applications.

REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

We have made significant efforts to ensure the reproducibility of our results. All model architectures,
training workflows, and hyperparameter settings are described in detail in Appendix. We also pro-
vide implementation-level descriptions of reward formulation, and theoretical analyses. The curated
benchmarks ( REAL-PREF, ATTACK-PREF) and evaluation metrics (ICS, RIC, DSR, etc.) are also
described in Appendix |G] These components are included to facilitate independent verification and
replication of our A-IPO framework.

A BACKGROUND

In this section, we provide a quick background of the widely used preference alignment pipeline:

RLHF (Ouyang et al.}/2022) as well as the widely used preference alignment methods: Direct Pref-
erence Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al.|{2023) and GDPO 2025).

A.1 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK (RLHF)

RLHF is a widely used preference alignment pipeline that consists of three main components:

(a) Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). The RLHF process starts with a supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
of the model with the human preference data. The SFT model is trained to generate outputs that are
preferred by the human. The resulting fine-tuned model is 75*?.

(b) Reward Modeling. In the next step the SFT model is prompted with the prompts x to generate
answer pairs (1, y2) ~ 7°*"(y|a). The response pairs are labeled by humans to express their prefer-
ence Yw > yi |x, where y, is the preferred answer and 1; is the less preferred answer. RLHF assumes
that these preferences are modeled by a latent reward model r* (x, y) that estimates the preference
of the human for the model output. Under the Bradley-Terry modeling assumption (Hunter} /2004),
the preference of the human for the model output is modeled as:

centr be, var)
expr" (oa,)) + expr", w) 20)

In order to parameterize the reward model, most widely used approach is to use maximum-likelihood
estimation (MLE) to estimate the parameters, given a data set of static distribution of preferences

DP (Yow > ylx) =

D = {x', yo, yf. This can be formulated as a binary classification problem with the negative
log-likelihood loss:

Leite = —Eqay.y:)~D | 10g o (re (2, Yw) — ro(2, ¥))] (11)

(c) RL Optimization. Finally, in the last step, the learned reward function is used to provide feed-
back to the language model. This process is formulated as:

max E,vp, ywro(yle) [r(#,y)] — BDxx{mo(yl2) || mree(yl@)] , (12)

6

where ({ is a hyper-parameter that controls the strength of the preference regularization, and
Tret (y|x) is the reference policy, which is often a pretrained language model (i.e., 75"), In practise,
the RL optimization is performed to optimize the policy to maximize the reward.

A.2. DIRECT POLICY OPTIMIZATION (DPO)

DPO is a machine learning approach specifically designed to address the challenge of aligning model
behavior with human preferences. DPO leverages direct human preferences, represented as pairwise
comparisons, to optimize model outputs, facilitating alignment without requiring explicit scalar re-
ward signals.

Formally, given a dataset consisting of pairs of outputs (y, yw) generated by the model from input
prompts x, and corresponding human preferences y,, > y; indicating that y,, is preferred over y),
the objective is to find model parameters 6 that maximize the likelihood of observed preferences.
Mathematically, the optimization objective of DPO can be formulated as:

max ) | log o (8 (ro(x, Yw) — To(x, y1)))

where g(x, y) represents the scalar reward or preference score assigned by the model with param-
eters 9 to output y given prompt x, o is the sigmoid function, and ( is a temperature parameter
controlling the sharpness of the preference distribution.

An essential component of DPO is the reward re-parameterization trick. Instead of modeling rewards
explicitly, DPO implicitly defines the reward function as a transformation of the policy distribution.


Given a reference policy 7ree(y|x) (often a pretrained language model), the re-parameterized reward
is given by:
Tr(y|2)

ro(x,y) = Blog + Blog Z(2).
ret (yl)

where 7,-(y|2) is the current policy being optimized, and Z(2:) is the partition function. This pa-
rameterization is applied to the ground-truth reward function r* and corresponding optimal policy
network 7* This re-parameterization allows direct optimization of the policy distribution based on
preference comparisons, streamlining alignment with human values without relying on explicit nu-
meric reward signals. Under Bradley-Terry model formulation, i.e., formulating it as a difference of
rewards: p*(yw > y|2) = o(r*(x, yw) — r*(x, yr), the preferece model satisfies:

1
P*(Yw > yl) = (Yw|2) m*(yila) \” ve)
L-; ep (4 log Ftyelzy ~ Blog eu)

It allows formulating the preferece distribution as a difference of optimal policies rather than the
reward models. For model training, a maximum-likelihood objective is used for the parameterized
policy 79(y|x). Hence, the objective function for DPO is given by:

Lopo(t93 tet) = —Evosyu any ogo (4 jaa Te(Yw | £) Blog Ta(yi | @) )| (14)

Tet (Yu | a) Tret (YI | x)
This way the DPO is able to implicitly fit a reward using an alternative parameterization with optimal

policy (7¢).
A.3. GROUP DISTRIBUTIONAL PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (GDPO)

GDPO (Yao et al.|[2025) addresses DPO’s limitations by explicitly modeling the diversity of human
preferences. Instead of directly learning pg(y|a), GDPO decomposes response generation into two
steps: (1) predicting a belief distribution over preference categories pg(b|a), and (2) generating
a response conditioned on both the input and a sampled belief po(y|b, x). The overall response
distribution is thus a mixture:

po(ylz) = )_ po(ylb, x) po(b|x) (15)

beB

Training GDPO involves two main objectives: belief calibration and belief-conditioned preference
alignment. The total loss is:

Leavo( 2; Digs YB; 0) = Lea. (po (b | x), Pp) = 6, 0B, thems vipa prel Uw a Yl; be, DB) (16)

where B = {bj,...,b;} is the set of belief categories, and p;(- | x) is a target belief distribution
(e.g., from group annotations). The belief calibration loss uses cross-entropy:
eat.(Do(- | x), PC | x) = — >) pb | 2) log po(b | 2) (17)
beB

For preference alignment, GDPO applies a DPO-style loss conditioned on each belief b:
Ay (23 Yws Ms 9) = (log m6 (Yw | x, b) — log 76 (yi | x, b))
— (log Tret(Yw | 2,0) — log Tree (ym | z, b))
lpret (Yow a yi, 6, x) = —loga(8 Ab (23 Yws Yas 0)), B>0 (18)
The final GDPO objective combines both terms, weighted by ¥:

Leppo() = E (ay gn.b)~D | Epret (Yow = yi, b, x) | +Y vx | Coat. (Do (+ | x), ppl: | x)) | (19)
where y > 0 balances the two losses.

At inference, responses can be generated either by sampling from the full mixture poly | a) or by
selecting the most probable belief 6 = arg max, p9(b | x) and decoding from po(y | x, b).
Relation to DPO. GDPO reduces to standard DPO when there is only one belief category (|B| = 1)

or when po(b | x) is deterministic. When beliefs capture genuine heterogeneity, GDPO enables the
model to learn belief-specific preference margins and aggregate them.


B_ LIMITATIONS OF DPO AND GDPO

B.1 LIMITATIONS OF DPO

Setup. The loss function of standard DPO (Rafailov et al.|/2023) is given by:

A(a; 0) = (Jog To(Yw | x) — log ro(y | x)) — (Jog mer | x) — log Tree(ys | x)). (20)

Here 7rg is the trainable policy, 7+e¢ is fixed reference model, 3 > 0 is a temperature, and o(t) =
We claim that the standard formulation of DPO poses the following limitations:

1
Ife"
(1) Global Preference Assumption—Average vs. Worst-case performance. The standard DPO
objective minimizes the average loss over all data:

Lave = z| —logo(B A)| . (21)

However, this does not guarantee good performance on the hardest cases. The worst-case loss is
defined as

Linax = esssup Evy, y,)~D(2) [— log a(8 A(x; Yws yt) | ; (22)

zx
where ess sup,, denotes the essential supremum over all possible inputs x, and the expectation is
taken over preference pairs (yw, yi) conditioned on x. Here, A(x; yw, y) is the log-odds difference
(or reward margin) for input x and response pair (yw, yi), and o(-) is the sigmoid function.

By definition, the average loss £,,, is always less than or equal to the worst-case loss Lyax, Le.,
Lave < Lmax, and equality holds only if every input x incurs the same loss. For example, if a
small fraction € of the data has loss A and the remaining 1 — € has loss B, then the average loss is
Lave = (1 — €)B + €A, which can be small even if the worst-case loss Lyax * A is large. Thus,
optimizing only the average loss may leave some inputs with very poor performance.

By contrast, our intent-based modeling approach explicitly accounts for latent heterogeneity by
learning a distribution over intents jointly with the policy. This enables the model to adapt to rare
or difficult contexts, effectively reducing the worst-case loss. Mathematically, our objective can be
written as

q(intent|x)

where the inner minimization over q allows the model to focus on the most challenging/latent inten-
tion assignments for each x, subject to a regularization term. This structure is closely related to a
robust optimization, aimed at minimizing the worst-case loss:

beEB

Thus, our method provides a tighter upper bound on the worst-case loss compared to standard DPO,
and empirically leads to more uniform performance across all inputs, including rare or difficult
cases.

(2) Inadequate Representation of Pluralistic Preferences. A key limitation of DPO arises when
the logit difference A is not constant but varies across hidden or latent contexts for the same input
x. In practical settings, x may correspond to a prompt or situation that admits multiple plausible
interpretations, hidden states, or sources of randomness (e.g., ambiguous instructions, stochastic
environments, or unobserved user intent). For each such context, the model may assign a different
value to A, reflecting the relative preference between y,, and y; under that context.

DPO, however, aggregates these variations by averaging the loss over all contexts. Mathematically,
the DPO loss for a given x is

t| — logo (8 A) | x], (25)
where the expectation is over the hidden contexts. By Jensen’s inequality and the convexity of
—logoa(8z), this average loss is always at least as large as the loss evaluated at the mean logit
difference:

B[ —logo(8A) |x] = —logo(SE[A | 2]). (26)


Equality holds only if A is constant given 2, i.e., there is no heterogeneity across contexts.

To illustrate the effect, consider a concrete example: suppose there are two equally likely hidden
contexts for a given x, with A, = +2 and Ay = —2. The average logit difference is E[A | x] = 0,
so the loss evaluated at the mean is — log a(0) = log 2. However, the true expected loss is

[— log o(BA) | a] = 5( — log o(26) — log o(—28)).

For any 3 > 0, this value is strictly greater than log 2, since — log 0 (2) and — log o(—2{) are both
greater than — log o(0). This gap quantifies the penalty incurred by ignoring the heterogeneity in A.

The practical implication is that DPO’s averaging procedure can obscure important differences be-
tween contexts, leading to a loss of information. If the model is trained to minimize the average
loss, it may fail to capture or exploit the diversity present in the data, and the resulting policy can
be biased or suboptimal in settings where latent diversity is significant. In particular, the model may
underperform on rare but important contexts, or may not learn to distinguish between cases that
require different behaviors. This limitation is especially relevant in real-world applications where
data is inherently heterogeneous and context-dependent.

(3) Relying solely on Relative Ordering. A key limitation of DPO and similar preference opti-
mization methods is their exclusive reliance on the relative ordering between a preferred response
Yw and a dispreferred response y;. This approach is problematic when both responses are of low
quality or far from the user’s true intent, as the model is only encouraged to make y,,, better than yj,
regardless of their absolute alignment with the underlying intent.

Formally, in the Bradley—Terry or Plackett-Luce framework, the log-odds of preferring y,, over y;
for input x are given by

logit Pr(yw» > y | 2) = Ar(a), Ar(x) := r(x, Yw) — r(x, 41), (27)
where r(, y) is the reward assigned to response y. In DPO, the reward is typically
rppo(#,y) = Blog TAWl®) (28)
Tret (y | x)
with 7 the policy and 7¢¢ the reference model.
The DPO loss and its gradient depend only on the difference Ar:
VoLppo « (1 — a(Ar)) VeAr, (29)

where o(-) is the sigmoid function. Importantly, this formulation is invariant to any additive,
response-independent shift b(x) in the reward, ie., r(x, y) + r(av,y) + b(x), and thus does not
constrain the absolute quality of either y,, or y;. As a result, the model can achieve Ar > 0 (and
thus minimize the loss) even if both y,, and y, are far from the true intent, leading to weak or brittle
preference margins.

(4) Lack of Resilience. A fundamental limitation of the DPO objective is the fact that it does not
provide explicit mechanism for inferring or detecting adversarial attacks based on the input prompt
x. By construction, DPO assumes that every prompt x comes from a benign distribution and treats
all inputs identically. The framework does not attempt to judge whether z is adversarial, ambiguous,
or malicious; instead, it only evaluates the relative preference between candidate outputs conditioned
on x. In particular, the DPO objective lacks any built-in adversarial defense mechanism—there is
no inner maximization over perturbations of x, no robustness margin against a threat set, and no
inference stage that could flag an input as adversarial.

This limitation follows directly from the problem formulation of DPO, which defines the learning
objective purely in terms of the expected preference loss:

Lppo(6) := E, [— logo (8 A(2;6)) J, (30)

where A(x; @) is the logit difference between preferred and dispreferred responses. Crucially, x
only appears as a conditioning variable in the expectation and plays no role in determining whether
the prompt itself is adversarial. Thus, by design, DPO optimizes preference alignment under the
given distribution of prompts, but it does not provide any safeguard or diagnostic against adversarial
manipulation of those prompts.



B.2 LIMITATIONS OF GDPO.

We clarify GDPO’s setup and why treating belief as an external input limits applicability.

Setup. Let b € B denote a belief category. GDPO uses an externally provided (or separately
predicted) belief distribution p(b | x) for each input x. Let

Ay (230) = (Jog To(Yw | x, 0) — log zo (y | w,b)) _ (Jog Tret(Yw | £0) — log Tree (yz | w,))

£(z) := — log a(z) (31)
be the belief-conditioned DPO logit and loss. The GDPO objective is
Levro(9; B) =Ex >> p(b | x) (6 Ao(a; 9). (32)
beB

By contrast, our method learns an intent distribution end-to-end as a latent variable jointly with the
policy, rather than relying on an external belief distribution p.

(1) No explicit belief-conditioned reward shaping. In the standard GDPO formulation above,
the belief b appears only through (i) conditioning of the policy/reference terms inside A, and (ii)
reweighting via p(b | x). There is no explicit additive shaping term that captures how b should
influence the reward/logit beyond reweighting. Formally, GDPO optimizes logits of the form

As (038) = (10g (yw | a,b) — log ro(ys |b) — (Tos met duo | 2,6) — log trer(yt | 2, 6)),
(33)
without an explicit belief-impact term.

By default, GDPO does not further leverage the belief variable to directly control the reward or
explicitly augment the preference alignment margin. The belief b only enters as a conditioning
variable and a reweighting factor, but its influence on the reward/logit is not separately parameterized
or shaped. As a result, GDPO lacks a mechanism to modulate the preference margin or reward based
on the strength or alignment of the belief itself.

In contrast, explicit intention-conditioned shaping (as employed by A-IPO) augments the logit with
a belief-aligned statistic s,(y) (such as a similarity or alignment score):

Ay (2; 6,A) = BA;p(a;0) + AAszp, Asp := $o(Yw) — So(yr), A> 0. (34)

This additional term enables direct and controllable adjustment of the preference margin along the
belief axis, thereby allowing more effective modeling and alignment of preferences than the default
GDPO formulation.

C A-IPO—MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

In contrast to the existing approach A-IPO firstly digs out the underlying intention Z within the
input prompt «x. Later, it explicitly constraints the reward function rg(x, y,Z) to ensure that the
prefered response y,, is more aligned with the intent Z, and the disprefered response y; is pushed
away from the intent Z. We claim this approach is more effective than existing works, that solely
work on the relative difference of rewards between y,, and y.

Human Preference Data Collection. Formally, given a collection of preference data pairs D =
{(x,Yw, yi) }, where for each prompt x, we first perform intent detection to extract the underlying
intent or latent variable Z associated with x. Here, y,,, denotes the preferred (“winner”) response
and y; denotes the less-preferred (“loser”) response. The detected intent Z is then used to inform
subsequent modeling of preferences and reward functions.

Augment Bradley—Terry Model with Variational Inference. We assume human preferences fol-
low a generalized Bradley—Terry (BT) model incorporating a latent variable 7:

exp(8r* (@, YwsZ))
exp(8r* (x, Yw,Z)) + exp(Br* (a, yr, Z))
—KL (ag(Z | #)|[p(Z)) ; (35)

log p(Yw > yw | &) > Eng, (z|x) [log


In this formulation:

The responses y,, (winner) and y (loser) are explicitly conditioned on the latent variable
TZ, which captures hidden contextual or user-specific factors underlying the prompt z.

r*(a,y, Z) denotes the (unknown) ground-truth reward function, representing the desirabil-
ity of response y given prompt z and latent intent Z.

2 is a temperature parameter that modulates the sharpness or sensitivity of the preference
model.

p(Z) is the prior distribution over the latent variable TZ.

qo(Z | x) is the variational posterior distribution over the latent variable Z, parameter-
ized by ¢, KL denotes the Kullback—Leibler divergence, which regularizes the variational
posterior q4(Z | a) towards the prior p(Z).

Direct computation of the expectation over Z is generally intractable. Therefore, we optimize a
variational lower bound (Evidence Lower Bound, ELBO) on the log-likelihood of observed human
preferences.

A-IPO Reward Modeling. We begin by explicitly defining our reward function, assuming both the
learned policy 7, and the reference policy 7;e¢ depend on a latent variable ZT:

log Z(x,Z
Tret(y | 2, Z) + Blog Z(2,7) a

r(x, y,Z) = Blog

A-IPO enforces an additional constraint for y,, to be more relevant with the intention Z, while at
the same time y; should be away from Z. For this we define a new reward function r_ as follows:

r (a,y,Z) = r(a,y,Z) + Asim(y, Z) (37)

The Bradley—Terry (BT) model considers only differences between rewards of two completions,
causing the normalization term Z(x, Z) to cancel:

PYw > Yt | Z) = Ezng, (z\z) lo (r (x, 4w,Z) — 7 (x,m,7))

Substituting the reward function explicitly, we first get:

* Tr (Your | x, TZ) Tree (Yt | =)
i wv) = Ee 2) |O lo
ts ula) ll dal | (s ° Tr (yi | 2, L) Tret(Yw | 2, LZ) (38)
+ X|sim(yw,Z) — sim(yr, Z)]
We can equivalently reorganize this clearly as a difference of fractions of log probabilities:
PYw ~ | ®) = Exmgg tle) |7(B(I0 lo )
Me | 8) Bayete 08 Fw 12) — 8 Hey [2D G39)

+ A [sim(y,,Z) — sim(y, Z)]
To optimize this, we use variational inference and define the corresponding ELBO (variational lower
bound) as follows:

fir hw | @,£) Tr (Yu | #2.)
Teale | 2D) 78 mealyn fst)
+ A fsim(yu,Z) — sim(y1,Z)] — KL (aa(Z | 2) || p(D))

(40)

log p(Yw > yw | x) > Ezng,(z\x) os (

Defining the Loss/Objective. We optimize both the variational parameters ¢ and the policy parame-
ters 9 jointly using gradient-based methods. To ensure the objective is practical for implementation,


we explicitly formulate the final loss as a negative log-likelihood (NLL) that can be directly mini-
mized during training. The complete training objective is:

— Alsim(yw,Z) — sim(y, Z)] + YEx~p [KL (qg(Z | «)||p(Z))]

D THEORETICAL ANALYSES OF A-IPO

Below, we introduce a lemma that provides a sufficient condition under which the intent-augmented
reward difference ensures that the “winner” (y,,) is favored over the “loser” (y,). Specifically, the
base reward difference Arpase(Z) captures the base model’s logit contribution, while the similarity
difference term 6 further adjusts this margin based on how much better y,, aligns with the inferred
intent Z compared to y. When 6 > 0, selecting A large enough to compensate for any negative
Arpase(Z) guarantees that the augmented margin Ar’ is strictly positive. A positive margin, in turn,
implies p(yw > yi | x) = o(Ar’) > §, so the intent-aligned response is preferred.

Lemma D.1 (Sufficient condition for intent-aligned preference). Let

Tr(Yw | ,Z) lo T(y | x,Z) )
Tret (Yw | x,T) Trot (YI | Dok) ,

AP pase (Z) = B (108

be the base reward difference conditioned on intent T. Let 6 := sim(yw,Z) —sim(y,, Z) and assume
6 > 0. Consider the similarity-augmented reward difference

Ar’ = Arpase(Z) + 46, A>.

If
(=2riage (Z) ) +
6

then Ar’ > 0. Consequently, with the logistic link o(t) =

’ > where (a) := max{a, 0},

lte-*?

P(Yw > yw |x) = o(Ar’) > 5.

Proof. By definition,

Ar! = Arpase(Z) + 6.
If Arpase(Z) > 0, then Ar’ > XS > O. If instead Arpase(Z) < 0, the assumed bound
A > (—Arpase(Z))/d ensures that Ar’ > 0. Since the logistic function o is strictly increasing
and satisfies o(0) = 4, it follows that Ar’ > 0 => o(Ar’) > $.

We further strengthen this observation via the following corollary. Rather than merely ensuring
Ar’ > 0, suppose we wish to achieve a margin of at least m > 0. In this case, it suffices to choose
large enough so that Ar’ > m. Specifically, the corollary shows that \ > (m — Arpase(Z))/6 guar-
antees the desired margin. If the base difference already exceeds m, then no additional constraint on
d is needed.

Corollary D.1 (Target margin). For any desired margin m > 0 (i.e., Ar’ > m), it suffices to choose

\> m— Arbase(Z)
6
In particular, if m > 0 and the right-hand side is negative, any \ > 0 suffices.

In the next corollary, we express the condition directly in terms of the Bradley—Terry probability.
Specifically, if the objective is to ensure p(y» > y | x) > q for some g > $3 it is sufficient that
Ar’ > logit(q). Equivalently, this yields the requirement \ > (logit(q) — Arpase(Z))/6. This
formulation provides an explicit guideline for selecting the intent weight 1 needed to achieve any

desired confidence level q in the preference probability.


Corollary D.2 (Target preference level). For any target probability q € (5, 1),

PYw>-ylx) = o(Ar') > q — _ Ar’ } logit(g) := log; _

Hence it suffices to take

Ss logit(q) — Arbase(Z)

ae 6 .
Remark D.1. The lemma and corollaries hold for any strictly increasing link g : R > (0, 1) in place
of o, with logit(q) replaced by g~*(q).

D.1 CONDITIONING ON INTENTION

Setup. Let Zx = o(X) and Zx,7 = o(X,T) with Zx C Zx,z. Let T be the target (e.g., a pairwise
preference label), and for any o-algebra Z let F(Z) denote the class of all Z-measurable predictors
taking values in an action space A. Let £: T x A— Rso bea (measurable) loss.

Lemma (Feature augmentation reduces Bayes risk). For any loss €, the Bayes risk with access
to (X,Z) is no larger than with access to X alone:

pat, BEAD) < int Ble(2.9(X))].

Proof. Because Zx C Zx 7, any g € F(Zx) induces f € F(Zx,z) via f(x,Z) = g(x). Hence
F(Zx) C F(Zx,z), and taking infima over a larger set cannot increase the value.

Theorem|5.2|(Likelihood improvement under conditioning). Let Rx be the class of rewards r that
depend only on «, and let Rx x be the class of rewards that may depend on (x,T). Assume a
fixed data-generating distribution for all random elements (inputs, comparison sets, labels), and
that E[ | log ppipr (data | r)|] < 00 for the r under consideration. Then

sup [log ppt pr (data | r)| > sup | log ppi pr (data | r)].
TERY sg rEeRX

Proof. Since Rx C Rx z (an x-only reward is also a function of (#,Z) that ignores Z), mini-
mizing expected negative log-likelihood over 7 x,z cannot be larger than over Rx by Lemma|5.1
Equivalently, the displayed inequality holds for the suprema of the expected log-likelihoods. LI

D.2 IMPACT OF SIMILARITY TERM IN THE REWARD

Corollary D.3 (Pairwise Bradley—Terry form). For any pair (yw, y1) and fixed (x,T),

T(Yw | ©,L)/Tret(Yw | 2, Z)

Hence, under the standard Bradley-Terry parameterization Pr(yw > y | v,Z) = a((r*(a, Yw,L)—
(hy yi,L))/8), we have

Priyw > yw | v,Z) = o(A log ratio + 4 Asim),

where A log ratio := (log t(Yw | z,Z) — log r(m | x,Z)) — (log tret (Yu | x, Z) — log tree(y |
z,Z)) and Asim := sim(y,,,Z) — sim(y,Z).
Remark D.2 (On assumptions and identifiability).

1. Z(x,Z) < co is mild: for finite Y(#,Z) it is automatic; for continuous V(x, Z) it requires
integrability of the exponential tilt relative to 7e¢(- |v, Z).

2. Rewards in PL/BT are identified only up to an (x, Z)-only baseline; our construction chooses
b(a,Z) = Blog Z(a,T).

3. Parameters (3, A, 7) are not jointly unique. Under the standard BT parameterization, only the
combination A log ratio + (A/)Asim is identified from pairwise preferences. A common prac-
tice is to fix @ and estimate A.


Lemma (Margin shift). Recall from Corollary that the Bradley—Terry log-odds for a
pair (Yw,y.) take the form: logit Pryw > y | 2) = GAlogratio + AAsim, with
Asim = sim(y,,Z) — sim(y;,Z). Let Apase := @ Alogratio be the DPO (base) logit and
A’ := Abase + A Asim the similarity-augmented logit. Then for any Asim > 0,

so the preference margin Strictly improves.

Proof. Let t := Asim. By assumption, t > 0. Under the Bradley—Terry/Plackett-Luce model, the
pairwise preference probability is Pr(y, > y | ©) = a(A) where o(z) = 1/(1 + e7*) and A is
the log-odds. The traditional DPO logit is Apase, and the intent-augmented logit is A’ = Abase + t.
Since a is strictly increasing on R, it follows immediately that
o(A’) = oO Dinge 7 t) > o(Abase) :
Equivalently, by the mean value theorem there exists € between Apase and Apase + ¢ such that
o(Avase + t) — 7(Arase) = to'(€) = to(€)(1 _ a(€)) > 0,

because o(€) € (0,1) for all finite €. Therefore the preference probability strictly increases. More-
over, in log-odds space the margin increases by exactly t, i.e., A’ — Abase = t > 0, establishing a
strict improvement in the preference margin.

Theorem[5.3|(NLL improvement). Let €g7(A) := — log o(A) be the Bradley-Terry pairwise NLL.
Then for any pair with Asim > 0 and X > 0,

ler (Abase a os Asim) < fer (Abase)

with strict inequality unless Asim = 0. Consequently, the dataset-average NLL is nonincreasing as
a function of \ whenever the average Asim is nonnegative.

Proof. lgr(-) is strictly decreasing, as 3,(A) = —o(—A) < 0. Thus increasing the logit by
\ Asim > 0 weakly decreases the loss, strictly if Asim > 0.

Remark D.3 (Robustness to surface-preference bias). When Apase < 0 (surface-preference bias),

a positive intent gap Asim > 0 and A > 0 yield A’ > 0 once NAsim > —Agases correcting
misorderings and reducing error. This recovers and generalizes the sufficient condition previously
stated.

E CONNECTION OF INTENTION LOSS TO ELBO.

Intention loss as a VI surrogate. Consider the Bernoulli likelihood

(s | v,Z) -Tl Bernoulli(s,; 7(gy,n(2,Z))),

with variational posterior gg (Z | ton) and prior p(Z). The corresponding ELBO is

K
Levpo.i(), ?) = apy (sx log o(gu,k) + (1 — sx) log (1 — o(gu.x))) — Dxx(4@ || p)-

k=1
The inner term is exactly the negative binary cross-entropy (BCE). Thus,
—Lerpo.i(, ) = Ez~q4[BCE(s, 7(gy(x,Z)))] + Dex (qe || P)-
In other words, the negative ELBO decomposes into the expected BCE plus the KL divergence.

Bounding the reconstruction term. Define mixture probabilities
pr(x) = Lina [o(gy,n(@,Z))], 1 @eon)% = pr(a).
By Jensen’s inequality (concavity of log),
“qa [8x log o(gy,n) + (1 — 8x) log(1 — o(9y,n))] S 8x logpe(x) + (1 — sx) log(l — px (2)).
Equivalently,

ag [BCE(sx, 0(9y,n))] 2 BCE(sx, px (x).



Practical surrogate. Thus, using ¢(Xcon)k = pe(£) in Equation [5] provides a computationally
cheap surrogate: the BCE evaluated at the mean probability gives a lower bound on the true recon-
struction loss. Minimizing this BCE therefore serves as a tractable approximation to the likelihood
component of the ELBO, though it does not capture the KL term.

F EVALUATION BENCHMARK CURATION

We describe the curation process for both REAL-PREF and ATTACK-PREF below.

REAL-PREF. REAL-PREF is constructed to assess A-IPO’s ability to capture and respect genuine
cultural and community-driven preferences. The process begins by identifying key real-world fac-
tors that vary across cultures and communities—such as names, food, and places—using Wikipedia
anchor links. These factors inform the construction of prompts, which are then used with OpenAI
GPT-4 model to generate pairs of preferred and non-preferred responses reflecting authentic regional
and social norms.

To ensure systematic and diverse coverage, the dataset spans six core domains: Culture, Food,
Health, Religion, Linguistics, and Music,includes 231 different intent categories. Domain-specific
Statistics of the dataset are shown in Table For each domain, we employ a unified template
structure with domain-specific adjustments. Each template includes:

¢ Theme Focus: Defines the theme and domain scope.

* Content Guidelines: Specifies requirements for scene description, background clues,
problem presentation, and suggestion format.

* Identity Context: Provides scenario background (e.g., time, roles, region, emotion).

¢ Response Format: Requires output in JSON with “acceptable response”
(accept_response) and ’response to be rejected” (re jJect_response).

¢ Examples: Supplies three illustrative cases.

Domain-specificity is achieved by varying the themes, contexts, and examples within each template.

Formally, let F = {f1, fo,..., fx} be the set of identified factors. For each f, € F, we generate

prompts {prompt\* 1 Mx j—1 and use GPT-4 to produce response pairs:

(yer, ye pret) ~ GPT(prompt\””),

where yn aligns with authentic norms and pret is less appropriate or culturally insensitive.

The dataset is:
DReat-PReF = U l) { (prompt\”? ) I oe if oan) f
k=1j=1

All data is reviewed and validated by human annotators to ensure factual accuracy and correctness,
making the benchmark a reliable measure of cultural sensitivity. The specific prompt template and
generation protocol are detailed in Appendix[I.5]

ATTACK-PREF. ATTACK-PREF is designed to rigorously evaluate model robustness against adver-
sarial and malicious prompts. The curation process consists of two main stages:

Stage I: Synthetic Data Generation. We use OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate a diverse set of
synthetic input—output pairs:

Dept = {(xi, ys) 4, (xi, yi) ~ GPT (prompt, ).

Stage 2: Adversarial Augmentation. Each instance (x;, y;) is then transformed by a data augmenta-
tion operator A, producing adversarial or corrupted variants:

Déinal = —_ {(x Yi) = —_ A(ai, yi) a.

Here, A(-) is applied by human annotators or curators, using established adversarial attack scenarios
from the literature.


From these, we construct preference pairs (yw, yi), Where yw = y; (the original response) and
yt = yf} (the corrupted response), to train and evaluate A-IPO’s ability to distinguish safe from
unsafe or misleading outputs. All data is rigorously validated by human annotators to ensure factual
accuracy, reliability, and the effectiveness of the adversarial challenge.

G ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

G.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
G.1.1 EVALUATION BENCHMARKS/TASKS

For performance evaluation of A-IPO, we use self-curated benchmarks as well as a variant of an
existing benchmark to ensure broad and consistent assessment. The details are as follows:

(i) REAL-PREF. This dataset encompasses 7,303 culturally diverse collection designed to capture
authentic preference variation across regions, religions, and social norms. It spans six core do-
mains—religion, food, health, geography, language, and music. The process-flow of data acquisi-
tion is described in Appendix|F| and the summary of corpus- and domain-level statistics is provided
in TableB]

(ii) ATTACK-PREF. This dataset comprises 6,758 adversarially augmented inputs designed to com-
prehensively evaluate model defenses against prompt-injection, misleading context, and semantic-
ambiguity exploits. Building on MKQA (Longpre et al.||2021), We utilize the instruction following
ability of the LLM to generate the final dataset. The process-flow of data acquisition is described in
Appendix [F} the specific prompt template and generation protocol are detailed in Appendix |I-6]

(iii) GlobalOpinionQA-Ext. To further complement the evaluation of A-IPO, we introduce
GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, an extended version of the GlobalOpinionQA dataset.
This extension is constructed from the “U.S.” subset of the original GlobalOpinionQA and is de-
signed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance on intent-driven prefer-
ence tasks. The creation of GlobalOpinionQA-Ext involves two key stages:

(a) Conversational Data Generation: For each multiple-choice question in GlobalOpinionQA, every
answer option is treated as representing a distinct intention and/or opinion. We rephrase these answer
options into a variety of conversational formats by leveraging DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al.|[2024). This
process ensures that the generated responses capture the underlying intent associated with each
answer, with particular attention to questions that reflect nuanced intent preferences.

(b) Conditional Pairwise Preference Construction: Next, we construct pairwise preference data by
utilizing country-specific opinion statistics available in GlobalOpinionQA. For each question, the
answer option with the highest acceptance rate (as indicated by the statistics) is designated as the
“preferred” response. A “rejected” response is then randomly selected from the remaining options.
This methodology grounds the constructed preference pairs in authentic, real-world distributions of
opinion and intent, thereby enhancing the validity and relevance of the evaluation.

Note, the summary and statistical overview, including train and test splits, of all evaluation data sets
is provided in Table[4]

G.1.2 EVALUATION METRICS

To rigorously assess the performance of A-IPO in terms of preference learning, alignment, and
adversarial robustness, we utilize the following quantitative evaluation metrics.

(i) Win Rate (Dudik et al.}|2015): This metric quantifies the fraction of evaluation instances where

the model’s response is judged superior to that of a baseline or reference model. In our setup,
the baseline is the test set response, and GPT-4 serves as an automatic judge to determine which
response is better. Formally, for N evaluation pairs:

N
i. 1 ~ ref ~
Win Rate = WV d I [Judge(7;, ie Hi ;

where 4; is our model’s response, y'* is the baseline response, and II[-] is the indicator function. The
prompt used for GPT-4-based judging is detailed in Appendix [7]

(ii) Intention-Consistency Score (ICS): ICS measures how consistently the intention model’s out-
put J; reflects the true intention Z across the test set. For this, we use GPT-4 to judge whether
predicted intention I; faithfully expresses the specified intention Z. The formal definition is:

N
S- I jz faithfully expresses Z] ,

w=1

1
ICS = —
N

where the indicator is 1 if GPT-4 judges T, as consistent with Z, and 0 otherwise. The evaluation
prompt is provided in Appendix|I.8]

(iii) Response-Intention Consistency (RIC): RIC measures how consistently the model’s response
y; reflects the true intention or belief Z. For this, we use GPT-4 to judge whether each response
faithfully expresses the specified intention. The formal definition is:
1a
RIC = W I [g; faithfully expresses T,] ,
where the indicator is 1 if GPT-4 judges 4; as consistent with Z;, and 0 otherwise. The evaluation
prompt is provided in Appendix |L.9]

(iv) Response Similarity (RS) (Yao et al.|/2025): RS evaluates the semantic similarity between the
model’s response 4; and a reference response y; (both expressing the same intention Z). We use
Sentence-BERT (all-mpnet-base-v2) to obtain embeddings, tokenize each response (up to 512 to-
kens), extract the [CLS] embedding, and apply L2 normalization. The cosine similarity is computed
as:

. _ a:b
Sim(0.°) = Toa

and the overall RS score is the average similarity across all N test samples:
1x
RS = 5 yD Sim(4:, yi).

(v) Defense Success Rate (DSR) (Wang et al.|!2024): DSR measures the proportion of adversarial

test cases in which the model’s response both completes the intended task and resists interference


from injected attacks. GPT-4 is used as an automatic judge to assess each response y;. The metric

is defined as:
N

1
DSR = WN ye I [y; successfully completes the task] ,
where the indicator is 1 if GPT-4 judges y; as a successful, attack-resilient completion. The evalua-
tion prompt is described in Appendix

These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of A-IPO’s ability to
align with user intent, maintain semantic fidelity, and defend against adversarial manipulations.

G.1.3. BASELINES

To thoroughly assess the effectiveness of A-IPO in modeling diverse, dynamic preferences and
improving adversarial robustness, we benchmark it against several representative baselines that span
the main paradigms of preference alignment:

(i) GDPO (Yao et al.}|2025). GDPO extends DPO by explicitly modeling group-level belief distri-
butions. It employs a two-stage process: first calibrating belief predictions, then aligning responses

conditioned on these beliefs. This baseline enables a direct comparison with A-IPO’s approach to
capturing implicit group or community preferences, especially in scenarios where group labels are
not pre-defined.

(ii) DPO (Rafailov et al.)/2023). DPO is a widely adopted baseline for preference alignment, which

directly optimizes model parameters using pairwise preference data (x, y, yj). The objective is to
maximize the likelihood of the preferred response y,,, over the less preferred y;, without the need for
explicit reward modeling. Its efficiency and simplicity make it a strong reference point for evaluating
A-IPO’s advances, particularly in handling pluralistic and nuanced preferences.

(iii) Few-shot Prompts. In this setting, a small number of exemplar input-output pairs are prepended
to each prompt, providing the model with in-context demonstrations to guide its responses. This
approach tests the model’s ability to leverage limited supervision for preference alignment. We use
3-shot exemplars for each prompt.

(iv) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Here, the base model is fine-tuned on preference data using
standard supervised learning objectives. SFT serves as a foundational baseline to assess the added
value of preference-based and intention-aware optimization.

Collectively, these baselines represent the breadth of current preference alignment strategies. By
comparing against them, we demonstrate that A-IPO’s intention bottleneck module and dynamic
intention inference provide superior adaptation to heterogeneous user preferences and enhanced
resilience to adversarial attacks.

G.1.4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

All experiments are conducted on a fixed dataset of preference optimization examples, where each
sample is a tuple (2, Xeon, Yw, yl). Here, x is the user prompt, 2con is a validated contextual augmen-
tation (constructed offline for reproducibility), y,, and y; are the more and less preferred responses.

Intention Module. The intention module is a BERT-base classifier trained on (2, %con,Z) with
intention (Z) as a single-label softmax objective. The classifier outputs a probability distribution
po(Z | £,%con), which is mapped to a continuous representation z via a trainable embedding table

Policy and Reference Models. Similar to DPO (Rafailov et al.| |2023) and GDPO (Yao et al.

2025), we use GPT2-Large (Radford et al.||2019) (774M parameters) and Pythia-2.8B (
2023), as our target LLMs. The reference model is obtained by supervised fine-tuning on
v,Yw

A-IPO Training. A-IPO is trained end-to-end. Speficically, the intention module qg(Z | x, Zon)
produces a distribution over intents, projected to a continuous representation z. The policy 79 is
optimized with an augmented preference loss (see main text for details), combining the DPO term
(temperature G = 0.1), an intention-consistency term (weighted by A), and a KL regularizer on the


variational posterior (weighted by ). The intention module parameters ¢ are updated jointly by the
classification loss and KL regularizer. The reference model 7c¢ is frozen during training.

Hyperparameters Setting. We perform hyperparameter selection by sweeping \ € {0.1, 0.2, 0.5}
and 7 € {0,0.01}, selecting the best model based on validation performance. Validation is con-
ducted every 1000 steps, and the checkpoint with the highest validation score is used for evaluation.
The policy parameters 0 are optimized using the RMSprop optimizer with a learning
rate =5 x 10~", G = 0.1, a linear warm-up of 150 steps, and bfloat16 precision. The intention mod-
ule parameters ¢ are trained with the AdamW optimizer with alearning
rate = 2 x 10~°, batch size 16, maximum sequence length 512), using a cross-entropy loss and early
stopping with a patience of 5 epochs. Gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 is applied
throughout training. All baseline models (SFT, DPO, GDPO, and A-IPO) are trained with the same
hyperparameters. All experiments are conducted on 2x A100 GPUs.

H ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS

In this section, we provide further experimental analyses to clarify and expand upon the performance
characteristics of A-IPO. These analyses build on the results presented in Section [7.4] offering
deeper insights into the model’s behavior across a range of scenarios.

H.1 IMPACT OF THE SIMILARITY TERM ON REWARD MARGIN

We empirically evaluate the effect of the intention-response similarity term, sim(y,Z), on the re-
ward margin using the training trajectories in Figure[2| We define the per-checkpoint reward margin
as:
Art = Eve,yy.n.)~D ie YurL) — 1'(x, 1,2) » (a,y,Z) = r(x,y,Z) + Asim(y,Z).
(42)

Under the Bradley—Terry formulation, the pairwise preference probability can be written as:
P(Yw > yr | x,Z) = of BAL + Asim),

Stele log aren is the DPO-style log-odds term and Asim :=

sim(y.,,Z) — sim(y;,Z). Consequently, whenever Asim > 0 (i.e., the preferred response is more
intent-consistent than the dispreferred one), the similarity term induces a positive logit shift and
increases the reward margin (Lemma[5.2).

where Afg := log

Empirically, the full model (with sim(y, Z)) achieves uniformly higher Ar, than the ablated variant
(without sim(y,Z)) throughout training on both GPT-2 Large and Pythia-2.8B. The larger margin
indicates sharper separation between preferred and dispreferred responses and is aligned with the
observed gains in robustness to adversarial or ambiguous inputs (cf. DSR improvements in Table[I).
These findings substantiate the theoretical margin-shift analysis and demonstrate that explicit intent—
response alignment stabilizes optimization by enlarging the effective preference gap.

Food Health Language Music Regional Religion

Intention Model 93.5 92.2 90.4 94.0 92.5 90.2 92.2

H.2 MAJORITY VS. MINORITY PREFERENCES

A central motivation for A-IPO is to address the inherent majority-vs-minority bias present in the
DPO training workflow, which tends to align model behavior with majority preferences at the ex-
pense of faithfully representing minority or subpopulation-specific intents. REAL-PREF was curated
as an evaluation benchmark specifically to probe intent alignment across a diverse distribution of
user intentions. This dataset comprises 231 distinct intention categories spanning six culturally
sensitive domains (e.g., Religion, Food, Regional Customs), with prompts constructed to reflect
subpopulation norms that encompass both majority preferences and minority groups. For example,
prompts in the Religion domain encode faith-based taboos (such as dietary prohibitions) that are
rarely encountered in standard training corpora. The results presented in Table[I]substantiate the ef-
fectiveness of A-IPO in overcoming majority bias: it achieves a Win-Rate of 68.1 (+9.5 over DPO),
RIC of 79.8 (+8.7), and RS of 59.4 (+4.8) on REAL-PREF, consistently outperforming strong base-
lines. These improvements demonstrate A-IPO’s enhanced ability to guide alignment for minority
groups and faithfully model intent across diverse and culturally nuanced scenarios.

In summary, A-IPO not only advances overall alignment metrics but also directly addresses fairness-
critical limitations of DPO by providing robust intent modeling for minority and underrepresented
groups—an essential property for real-world deployment in pluralistic and culturally diverse set-
tings.

H.3. ROBUSTNESS TO ADVERSARIAL AND NOISY INPUTS

We re-assess the robustness of A-IPO to adversarial attacks by conducting a focused evaluation on
the ATTACK-PREF dataset, which is specifically designed to probe model behavior under adversarial
and suboptimal conditions (see Table[I]and Table[2h. For GPT2-Large, DPO attains a DSR of 66.8%,
while A-IPO achieves a higher 73.5% (+6.7). On Pythia-2.8B, DPO’s DSR drops sharply to 41.1%,
but A-IPO maintains a robust 71.6% (+30.5). These results underscore A-IPO’s superior resilience
to adversarial attacks and worst-case scenarios. Notably, aggregate DSR scores can obscure the true
impact of adversarial prompts, as they average over both straightforward and challenging cases.

Ablation studies further reveal that this robustness is primarily attributable to the latent intention
variable Z. When Z is removed ((—Z)), DSR decreases by 8.6% (GPT2-Large) and 7.4% (Pythia-
2.8B), demonstrating that explicit intent disentanglement is critical for defending against adversarial
prompt perturbations (e.g., injected distractors such as “Do elephants fly?”). Additionally, A-IPO
enhances preference modeling even when both response candidates are of low quality. On GPT2-
Large, it achieves a Win-Rate of 39.1 (vs. 34.9 for DPO) and RS of 77.1 (vs. 70.8); on Pythia-2.8B,
Win-Rate is 37.1 (411.2) and RS is 57.7 (+3.7). This demonstrates A-IPO’s ability to prioritize
intent alignment over mere relative ranking, even in challenging settings.

Overall, across both model scales, A-IPO consistently demonstrates stable and robust performance
in the face of adversarial attacks and noisy inputs—contrasting with DPO and GDPO, which exhibit
marked vulnerability to intent obfuscation.

H.4. ANALYSIS OF INTENTION MODULE

This section presents a formal evaluation of the intention module’s performance, measured by the
Intention-Consistency Score (ICS) on REAL-PREF and its six constituent sub-datasets. Correspond-
ing results are reported in Table [5] The analysis emphasizes domain-specific outcomes and their
implications for preference alignment within the A-IPO framework.

Consistently high ICS across domains. The intention module demonstrates robust and consistent
performance, achieving ICS values between 90.2% and 94.0% across all evaluated domains. This
indicates strong generalization capability and adaptability to diverse domain characteristics. The


Music (94.0%) and Food (93.5%) domains exhibit the highest ICS, likely attributable to the presence
of explicit cultural markers (e.g., regional music genres, dietary restrictions) that facilitate intent
extraction. Conversely, the Religion (90.2%) and Language (90.4%) domains yield slightly lower
scores, reflecting the increased complexity and ambiguity inherent in parsing intent within these
contexts. For example, nuanced distinctions in religious observances (such as prayer schedules)
and subtle linguistic cues (such as levels of formality) present greater challenges for accurate intent
inference.

Relevance to minority preference modeling. Despite minor inter-domain differences, the in-
tention module maintains ICS above 90% in all cases, ensuring reliable intent inference even in
subpopulation-specific or culturally nuanced scenarios. In cross-domain evaluations, ICS remains
stable in the range of 92.2%-92.5%, providing a dependable basis for A-IPO to align preferences
without being adversely affected by intent inference errors. Notably, the consistently high ICS, even
in more challenging domains, mitigates the risk of misalignment that often arises from underrepre-
sented or culturally specific inputs. This directly addresses a key limitation of DPO, which tends to
prioritize majority interpretations at the expense of minority or less common preferences.

J USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

We used Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in polishing the manuscript. All content gen-
erated with the help of LLMs was carefully reviewed, verified, and edited by the authors to ensure
accuracy and originality. We take full responsibility for all content in the paper, including any parts

assisted by LLMs.

K_ LIMITATIONS

We enumerate the limitations of A-IPO as follows:

1. Dependence on intention module quality: The extraction and modeling of user intentions in A-
IPO rely on the quality and coverage of the intention module, which may not generalize well to

highly ambiguous or underspecified prompts.

2. Assumption of reliable fact-checking and retrieval: Our approach assumes access to robust
fact-checking and retrieval mechanisms; in domains with limited external knowledge or noisy

retrieval, intention inference and alignment may degrade.

3. Computational overhead: The additional computational cost introduced by intention modeling
and similarity evaluation can limit scalability, particularly for large-scale or real-time applica-

tions.


4. Potential for bias: As with all preference-based learning systems, A-IPO may still be suscepti-
ble to subtle biases present in training data or annotation processes, and further work is required
to ensure fairness and robustness in deployment.
