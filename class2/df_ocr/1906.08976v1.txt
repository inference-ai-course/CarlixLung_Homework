Abstract

As Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Machine Learning (ML) tools rise in popu-
larity, it becomes increasingly vital to recog-
nize the role they play in shaping societal bi-
ases and stereotypes. Although NLP models
have shown success in modeling various ap-
plications, they propagate and may even am-
plify gender bias found in text corpora. While
the study of bias in artificial intelligence is not
new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP
are relatively nascent. In this paper, we review
contemporary studies on recognizing and mit-
igating gender bias in NLP. We discuss gender
bias based on four forms of representation bias
and analyze methods recognizing gender bias.
Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and
drawbacks of existing gender debiasing meth-
ods. Finally, we discuss future studies for rec-
ognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP.

1 Introduction

Gender bias is the preference or prejudice to-
ward one gender over the other (Moss-Racusin
et al., 2012). Gender bias is exhibited in multi-
ple parts of a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
system, including the training data, resources, pre-
trained models (e.g. word embeddings), and al-
gorithms themselves (Zhao et al., 2018a; Boluk-
basi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al.,
2018). NLP systems containing bias in any of
these parts can produce gender biased predictions
and sometimes even amplify biases present in the
training sets (Zhao et al., 2017).

The propagation of gender bias in NLP algo-
rithms poses the danger of reinforcing damaging

stereotypes in downstream applications. This has
real-world consequences; for example, concerns
have been raised about automatic resume filter-
ing systems giving preference to male applicants
when the only distinguishing factor is the appli-
cants’ gender.

One way to categorize bias is in terms of allo-
cation and representation bias (Crawford, 2017).
Allocation bias can be framed as an economic is-
sue in which a system unfairly allocates resources
to certain groups over others, while representa-
tion bias occurs when systems detract from the so-
cial identity and representation of certain groups
(Crawford, 2017). In terms of NLP applications,
allocation bias is reflected when models often per-
form better on data associated with majority gen-
der, and representation bias is reflected when asso-
ciations between gender with certain concepts are
captured in word embedding and model parame-
ters. In Table 1, we categorize common examples
of gender bias in NLP following Crawford (2017).

Word Embedding Analogies such as “man : woman :: computer programmer : homemaker” | VV | Vv | Vv | ¥v
are automatically generated by models trained on biased word
embeddings (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).

Table 1: Following the talk by Crawford (2017), we categorize representation bias in NLP tasks into the following
four categories: (D)enigration, (S)tereotyping, (R)ecognition, (U)nder-representation.

Briefly, denigration refers to the use of culturally
or historically derogatory terms; stereotyping re-
inforces existing societal stereotypes; recognition
bias involves a given algorithm’s inaccuracy in
recognition tasks; and under-representation bias is
the disproportionately low representation of a spe-
cific group. We identify that both allocative and
representational harms often arise in NLP systems
due to statistical patterns in the training corpora,
which are then embedded in semantic representa-
tions and the model.

Gender bias in NLP is a complex and com-
pound issue, requiring interdisciplinary communi-
cation. As NLP systems have been increasingly
integrated with our daily life thanks to modern AI
developments, we need both immediate solutions
to patch current systems as well as fundamental
approaches to debias. In this paper, we provide a
comprehensive literature review to summarize re-
cent attempts for recognizing and mitigating bias
in NLP systems. Most debiasing methods can be
depicted as a special case in Figure 1.

We make two primary contributions. (1) We
summarize recent studies of algorithmic bias in
NLP under a unified framework for the ease of fu-
ture discussion. (2) We critically discuss issues
with current debiasing methods with the purpose
of identifying optimizations, knowledge gaps, and
directions for future research.

2 Observing Gender Bias

Recent work in analyzing gender bias in NLP has
focused on quantifying bias through psycholog-
ical tests, performance differences between gen-
ders for various tasks, and the geometry of vector
spaces. We provide an overview of gender bias

evaluation methods and discuss types of represen-
tation bias each method identifies.

2.1 Adopting Psychological Tests

In psychology, the Implicit Association Test ([AT)
is used to measure subconscious gender bias in hu-
mans, which can be quantified as the difference in
time and accuracy for humans to categorize words
as relating to two concepts they find similar ver-
sus two concepts they find different (Greenwald
et al., 1998; Caliskan et al., 2017). For instance,
to measure subconscious associations of genders
with arts and sciences, participants are asked to
categorize words as pertaining to (males or the
sciences) or (females or the arts) (Nosek et al.,
2009). The participants are then asked to catego-
rize words as pertaining to (males or the arts) or
(females or the sciences). If participants answered
faster and more accurately in the former setting,
it indicates that humans subconsciously associate
males with the sciences and females with the arts.

Caliskan et al. (2017) adopt the IAT’s core con-
cept, measuring gender bias through the differ-
ence in strength of association of concepts, to
measure bias in word embeddings using the Word
Embedding Association Test (WEAT) (Caliskan
et al., 2017). The authors confirm that human
biases found through IAT tests exist in GloVe
and Word2Vec embeddings. Finally, the authors
demonstrate a positive correlation between the
strength of association of an occupation word em-
bedding with the female gender and the percent-
age of females in that occupation in United States,
with the percentages taken from Bureau of La-
bor Statistics labor force participation data. No-
tably, Garg et al. (2018) show that bias in word


embeddings can be used to track social changes
such as increased or decreased female participa-
tion in the workforce. May et al. (2019) extend
WEAT to create the Sentence Encoder Association
Test (SEAT), capable of testing sentence encoders
(e.g., ELMo (Peters et al., 2018)) for human biases
found in JAT tests.

2.2 Analyzing Gender Sub-space in
Embeddings

Bolukbasi et al. (2016) define gender bias as the
correlation between the magnitude of the projec-
tion onto the gender subspace of a word embed-
ding representing a gender-neutral word and that
word’s bias rating, as rated by crowd workers. To
identify the gender subspace, they first build a lin-
ear support vector machine to classify words into
a set of gender-specific and a set of gender-neutral
words based on a training set of hand-selected
gender-specific words. The authors then identify
a gender direction by aggregating ten gender pairs
(e.g. she-he, her-his, woman-man, etc.) and us-
ing principal component analysis to find a single
eigenvector that exhibits significantly greater vari-
ance than the rest. Manzini et al. (2019) extend
this method and their approach can be used to find
non-binary gender bias by aggregating n-tuples in-
stead of gender pairs.

However, Gonen and Goldberg (2019) note that
the above method fails to capture the full picture of
gender bias in vector spaces. Specifically, even af-
ter the projections of word embeddings represent-
ing gender-neutral words onto the gender subspace
have been removed, word embeddings represent-
ing words with similar biases still cluster together.
They further introduce the notion of cluster bias.
Cluster bias of a word w can be measured as the
percentage of male or female stereotypical words
among the k nearest neighbors of w’s embedding
where the male or female stereotypical words are
obtained through human annotation.

2.3 Measuring Performance Differences
Across Genders

In most NLP tasks, a model’s prediction should
not be heavily influenced by the gender of the en-
tity mentions or contexts in the input. To evaluate
whether or not this is the case, consider two sen-
tences that act as the inputs to a model for which
the only differences are the words that correspond
to gender, such as “He went to the park” vs “She
went to the park”. We refer to changing the gen-

der of the gendered nouns as gender-swapping.
Gender-swapping can be generalized to sentences
by swapping each male-definitional word with its
respective female equivalent and vice-versa (Zhao
et al., 2018a; Lu et al., 2018; Kiritchenko and Mo-
hammad, 2018). If the model does not make deci-
sions based on genders, it should perform equally
for both sentences. Otherwise, the difference in
evaluation scores reflects the extent of gender bias
found in the system.

For example, Dixon et al. (2017) introduce two
metrics to measure these performance differences
— False Positive Equality Difference (FPED) and
False Negative Equality Difference (FNED) — that
have been used to measure gender bias in abusive
language detection (Park et al., 2018). These are
defined as the differences in the false positive and
false negative rates, respectively, of predictions of
a model between original and gender-swapped in-
puts. We note that these measurements can gener-
alize to tasks aside from abusive language detec-
tion.

By designing test sets, measuring performance
differences between genders reveals representa-
tional gender bias in the context of recognition,
stereotyping, and under-representation. If, for in-
stance, an image captioning model is worse at rec-
ognizing a woman than a man when they are each
sitting in front of a computer (Burns et al., 2018),
that is a clear indicator of recognition bias. If
this prediction inaccuracy arises as a consequence
of the algorithm’s association between man and
computer, then this example also reveals stereo-
typing in the image captioning model. One can
also imagine that if the model is not debiased and
these errors propagate over a large sample of im-
ages, then the model may further contribute to the
under-representation of minority.

Standard evaluation data sets in NLP are inad-
equate for measuring gender bias. For one, these
data sets often also contain biases (such as con-
taining more male references than female refer-
ences), so evaluation on them might not reveal
gender bias. Furthermore, predictions made by
systems performing complex NLP tasks depend
on many factors; we must carefully design data
sets to isolate the effect of gender of the output in
order to be able to probe gender bias. We name
these data sets Gender Bias Evaluation Testsets
(GBETs).

The goal of designing GBETs is to provide

check that NLP systems avoid making mistakes
due to gender bias. Some may argue that the ar-
tificial design of GBETs does not reflect the true
distribution of the data, implying that these evalu-
ations are artificial. We argue that if humans can
avoid making mistakes due to gender bias, then
machines should as well. Additionally, systems
that make biased predictions may discourage mi-
norities from using those systems and having their
data collected, thus worsening the disparity in the
data sets (Hashimoto et al., 2018). We provide an
overview of publicly available GBETs in Table 2.

Gender-swapped GBETs: In the following,
we review GBETs in coreference resolution and
sentiment analysis applications.

For coreference resolution, Rudinger et al.
(2018) and Zhao et al. (2018b) independently
designed GBETs based on Winograd Schemas.
The corpus consists of sentences which contain
a gender-neutral occupation (e.g., doctor), a sec-
ondary participant (e.g., patient), and a gendered
pronoun that refers either the occupation or the
participant. The coreference resolution system re-
quires the identification of the antecedent of the
pronoun. For each sentence, Rudinger et al. (2018)
consider three types of pronouns (female, male, or
neutral), and Zhao et al. (2018b) consider male
and female pronouns. The two datasets have
a few notable differences (see the discussion in
(Rudinger et al., 2018)).

Note that simply measuring a global difference
in accuracies of a model between inputs with dif-
ferent gendered pronouns is insufficient. For ex-
ample, a model could predict females and males
to be coreferent to “secretary” with 60% and 20%
accuracy, respectively. If that same model pre-
dicts females and males coreferent to “doctor”
with 20% and 60% accuracy, respectively, then the
global average accuracy for each gender is equiva-
lent, yet the model exhibits bias.! Therefore, Zhao

'For the sake of simplicity, we illustrate the motivation
in accuracy. The coreference resolution systems may be eval-
uated using a different metric.

et al. (2018b) and Rudinger et al. (2018) design
metrics to analyze gender bias by examining how
the performance difference between genders with
respect to each occupation correlate with the occu-
pational gender statistics from the U.S Bureau of
Labor Statistics.

Another GBET for coreference resolution
named GAP contains sentences mined from
Wikipedia and thus can perform an evaluation
with sentences taken from real contexts as op-
posed to artificially generated ones (Webster et al.,
2018). GAP does not include stereotypical nouns;
instead, pronouns refer to names only. Gender bias
can be measured as the ratio of F) scores on in-
puts for which the pronoun is female to inputs for
which the pronoun is male. Notably, sentences are
not gender-swapped, so there may be differences
in difficulty between sentences in male and female
test sets.

For sentiment analysis, a GBET dataset
named Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC) (Kir-
itchenko and Mohammad, 2018) is designed. Each
EEC sentence contains an emotional word (e.g.,
anger, fear, joy, sadness), with one of five in-
tensities for each emotion and a gender-specific
word. Gender bias is measured as the difference
in emotional intensity predictions between gender-
swapped sentences.

3 Debiasing Methods Using Data
Manipulation

Several approaches have been proposed for debi-
asing gender stereotypes in NLP by working on
two tangents: (1) text corpora and their represen-
tations and (2) prediction algorithms. In this sec-
tion, we will discuss the techniques to debias text
corpora and word embeddings. We do the same for
techniques to mitigate gender bias in algorithms in
Section 4.

We note that debiasing methods can be catego-
rized as retraining and inference (see Table 3). Re-
training methods require that the model is trained


again, while inference methods reduce bias with-
out requiring the existence of the original training
set. Retraining methods tend to address gender
bias in its early stages or even at its source. How-
ever, retraining a model on a new data set can be
costly in terms of resources and time. Inference
methods, on the other hand, do not require models
to be retrained; instead, they patch existing models
to adjust their outputs providing a testing-time de-
biasing. We will discuss different debiasing meth-
ods from these two perspectives.

3.1 Debiasing Training Corpora

We review three approaches for debiasing gender
in the literature.

3.1.1 Data Augmentation

Oftentimes a data set has a disproportionate num-
ber of references to one gender (e.g. OntoNotes
5.0) (Zhao et al., 2018a). To mitigate this, Zhao
et al. (2018a) proposed to create an augmented
data set identical to the original data set but bi-
ased towards the opposite gender and to train
on the union of the original and data-swapped
sets. The augmented data set is created using
gender-swapping. This is similar to the method
used to create GBETs; however, the goal of data
augmentation is to debias predictions by training
the model on a gender-balanced data set, while
GBETs are created specifically to evaluate the
gender bias of those predictions both before and
after debiasing.

Data augmentation works as follows: for ev-
ery sentence in the original data set, create that
sentence’s gender-swapped equivalent using the
procedure described in 2.3. Next, apply name-
anonymization to every original sentence and its
gender-swapped equivalent. Name anonymiza-
tion consists of replacing all named entities with
anonymized entities, such as “E1”. For instance,
Mary likes her mother Jan becomes E1 likes his fa-
ther E2 after applying gender-swapping and name
anonymization for data augmentation. This re-
moves gender associations with named entities in
sentences. The model is then trained on the union
of the original data set with name-anonymization
and the augmented data set. The identification of
gender-specific words and their equivalent oppo-
site gender word requires lists typically created by
crowd workers.

Data augmentation has been shown to be flex-
ible; it can mitigate gender bias in several differ-

Table 3: Debiasing methods can be categorized ac-
cording to how they affect the model. Some debias-
ing methods require the model to be retrained after de-
biasing (Retraining). Others modify existing models’
predictions or representations (Inference).

ent models in many different tasks. When applied
to a neural network based coreference resolution
model (Lee et al., 2017, 2018) originally trained
on OntoNotes 5.0 which was tested on WinoBias,
gender augmentation lowered the difference be-
tween F scores on pro-stereotypical and anti-
stereotypical test sets significantly, which indi-
cates the model was less inclined to make gender-
biased predictions (Zhao et al., 2018a, 2019). In
hate speech detection, data augmentation reduced
FNED and FPED differences between male and
female predictions of a Convolutional Neural Net-
work by a wide margin (Park et al., 2018). Data
augmentation without name-anonymization has
also been used to debias knowledge graphs built
from Bollywood movie scripts (Madaan et al.,
2018) by swapping the nodes for the lead actor
and actress, but metrics evaluating the success of
gender-swapping were not provided.

Data augmentation is easy to implement, but
creating the annotated list can be expensive if there
is high variability in the data or if the data set is
large since more annotations will be required. Fur-
thermore, data augmentation doubles the size of
the training set, which can increase training time
by a factor specific to the task at hand. Lastly,
blindly gender-swapping can create nonsensical
sentences — for example, gender-swapping “she
gave birth” to “he gave birth” (Madaan et al.,
2018).

3.1.2 Gender Tagging

In some tasks, like Machine Translation (MT),
confounding the gender of the source of a data
point can lead to inaccurate predictions. Current
MT models predict the source to be male a dis-
proportionate amount of time (Prates et al., 2018;
Vanmassenhove et al., 2018). This happens be-
cause training sets are dominated by male-sourced


data points, so the models learn skewed statisti-
cal relationships and are thus more likely to pre-
dict the speaker to be male when the gender of
the source is ambiguous (Vanmassenhove et al.,
2018).

Gender tagging mitigates this by adding a tag
indicating the gender of the source of the data
point to the beginning of every data point. For in-
stance, “I’m happy” would change to “MALE ’'m
happy.” In theory, encoding gender information in
sentences could improve translations in which the
gender of the speaker affects the translation (i.e.
“Tam happy” could translate to “Je suis heureux”
[M] or “Je suis heureuse” [F]), since English does
not mark the gender of the speaker in this case.
The tag is then parsed separately from the rest of
the data by the model. The goal is to preserve
the gender of the source so the model can create
more accurate translations (Vanmassenhove et al.,
2018).

Gender tagging is effective: a Sequence-to-
Sequence Neural Network trained on Europarl in-
creased BLEU scores significantly for machine
translations from English to French in which the
first-person speaker was female (Vanmassenhove
et al., 2018). Sentences with male first-person
speakers had accuracy increases by a sizeable
margin. However, gender-tagging can be expen-
sive: knowing the gender of the source of a data
point requires meta-information, and obtaining
this could be costly in terms of memory usage and
time. Furthermore, MT models may need to be
redesigned to correctly parse the gender tags.

3.1.3 Bias Fine-Tuning

Unbiased data sets for a given task may be scarce,
but there may exist unbiased data sets for a re-
lated task. Bias fine-tuning incorporates transfer
learning from an unbiased data set to ensure that
a model contains minimal bias before fine-tuning
the model on a more biased data set used to train
for the target task directly (Park et al., 2018). This
allows models to avoid learning biases from train-
ing sets while still being adequately trained to per-
form a task.

Bias fine-tuning has been shown to be relatively
effective. Park et al. (2018) use transfer learning
from a gender unbiased abusive tweets data set
(Founta et al., 2018) and fine-tuning on a gender-
biased sexist tweets data set (Waseem and Hovy,
2016) to train a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). They evaluate the CNN using a GBET

evaluation set (which is private, so not mentioned
in 2.3). They tested the same model after train-
ing it on gender-swapped data sets as well. Park
et al. (2018) find that gender-swapping was more
effective at both removing bias and retaining per-
formance than bias fine-tuning. However, trans-
fer learning may have been ineffective in this case
because abusive language detection data sets and
sexist language detection data sets have significant
differences. For more similar data sets, bias fine-
tuning may be more effective; further testing is
necessary.

3.2 Debiasing Gender in Word Embeddings

Word embeddings represent words in a vector
space. These embeddings have been demonstrated
to reflect societal biases and changing views dur-
ing social movements in the United States (Garg
et al., 2018).

As the word embedding model is a fundamen-
tal component in many NLP systems, mitigating
bias in embeddings plays a key role in the reduc-
tion of bias that is propagated to downstream tasks
(e.g., (Zhao et al., 2018a)). However, it is debat-
able if debiasing word embeddings is a philosoph-
ically right step towards mitigating bias in NLP.
Caliskan et al. (2017) argue that debiasing word
embeddings blinds an AI agent’s perception rather
than teaching it to perform fair actions. We refer
readers to the discussion in (Caliskan et al., 2017).

It is also important to recognize that removing
gender bias from the embedding space entirely is
difficult. While existing methods successfully mit-
igate bias with respect to projection onto the gen-
der subspace in some degrees, Gonen and Gold-
berg (2019) show that gender bias based on more
subtle metrics such as cluster bias still exist.

In the following we review two families of ap-
proaches to debias gender in word embeddings.
One difference between these two types of meth-
ods is that the former does not require retraining
embeddings, whereas the latter does.

3.2.1 Removing Gender Subspace in Word
Embeddings

Schmidt (2015) first removed similarity to the gen-
der subspace in word embeddings by building a
genderless framework using cosine similarity and
orthogonal vectors (Schmidt, 2015). Removing
the gender component, though, pushes the word
he to become the 6th closest word to she when it
was the 1,826th closest previously. The genderless

framework may be flawed because the semantic
definition of a given word may be closely tied to
its gender component. However, a case can also be
made that a word’s gender component should play
a key role in its semantic definition. We encourage
future work to collaborate with social scientists for
further discussion on this topic.

Bolukbasi et al. (2016) build upon Schmidt
(2015) and propose to surgerically alter the em-
bedding space by removing the gender compo-
nent only from gender-neutral words. Instead of
removing gender altogether, debiasing involves
making gender-neutral words orthogonal to the
gender direction (see Figure 2). Ultimately, word
embeddings with reduced bias performed just as
well as unaltered embeddings on coherence and
analogy-solving tasks (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).

3.2.2 Learning Gender-Neutral Word
Embeddings

Zhao et al. (2018b) propose a new method called
GN-GloVe that does not use a classifier to cre-
ate a set of gender-specific words. The authors
train the word embeddings by isolating gender
information in specific dimensions and maintain-
ing gender-neutral information in the other dimen-
sions. They do this by (1) minimizing the neg-
ative difference (i.e. maximizing the difference)
between the gender dimension in male and female
definitional word embeddings and (2) maximizing
the difference between the gender direction and
the other neutral dimensions in the word embed-

dings. This allows for greater flexibility; the gen-
der dimensions can be used or neglected.

Finally, we note that both aforementioned ap-
proaches (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al.,
2018b) used to debias word embeddings may not
work with embeddings in a non-Euclidean space,
such as Poincare embeddings (Nickel and Kiela,
2017), because the notion of cosine similarity
would no longer apply. Also, it is unclear if these
approaches can be extended to other languages be-
yond English, especially for languages with gram-
matical genders.

4 Debiasing by Adjusting Algorithms

Some gender debiasing methods in NLP adjust
predictions in NLP systems. We call these algo-
rithm adjustment methods. In this section, we dis-
cuss two such approaches.

4.1 Constraining Predictions

Zhao et al. (2017) show that an NLP model risks
amplifying bias by making predictions which ex-
acerbate biases present in the training set. For in-
stance, if 80% of coreferents of “secretary” are fe-
male in a training set and a model trained on that
set predicts 90% of coreferents of “secretary” in
a test set to be female, then that model amplifies
bias.

Zhao et al. (2017) proposed Reducing Bias Am-
plification (RBA) based on a constrained condi-
tional model (Roth and Yih, 2004), which takes an
existing model’s optimization function and con-
strains that function to ensure its predictions fit de-
fined conditions. For example, when RBA was ap-
plied to the visual semantic role labelling (Yatskar
et al., 2016), it restricted the ratio of males to fe-
males predicted to be doing particular activities to
prevent the model from amplifying bias through
predictions. The approximate inference can be ef-
ficient solved by Lagrangian relaxation (Rush and
Collins, 2012).

4.2 Adversarial Learning: Adjusting the
Discriminator

Zhang et al. (2018) propose a variation on the tra-
ditional generative adversarial network (Goodfel-
low et al., 2014) by having the generator learn with
respect to a protected gender attribute. In other
words, the generator attempts to prevent the dis-
criminator from identifying the gender in a given
task such as analogy completion. This method has


the potential to be generalizable: it can be used to
debias any model that uses gradient-based learn-

5 Conclusion and Future Directions

In this paper, we summarize recent literature about
recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP.
We acknowledge that the scope of this paper is
limited. There is a long history of gender stereo-
type study in law, psychology, media study, and
many other disciplines which we do not discuss.
Similar issues of algorithmic bias have also been
discussed extensively in artificial intelligence, ma-
chine learning, data mining, and several other ap-
plication fields (e.g., (Calders and Verwer, 2010;
Feldman et al., 2015; Hardt et al., 2016; Misra
et al., 2016; Kleinberg et al., 2016; Pleiss et al.,
2017; Beutel et al., 2017; Misra et al., 2016)).
Other important aspects such as model/data trans-
parency (Mitchell et al., 2019; Bender and Fried-
man, 2018) and privacy preservation (Reddy and
Knight, 2016; Elazar and Goldberg, 2018; Li etal.,
2018) are also not covered in this literature sur-
vey. Besides, we refer the readers to Hovy and
Spruit (2016) for a more general discussion of eth-
ical concern in NLP.

The study of gender bias in NLP is still rela-
tively nascent and consequently lacks unified met-
rics and benchmarks for evaluation. We urge re-
searchers in related fields to work together to cre-
ate standardized metrics that rigorously measure
the gender bias in NLP applications. However, we
recognize that different applications may require
different metrics and there are trade-offs between
different notions of biases (Barocas et al., 2018;
Chouldechova and Roth, 2018).

Gender debiasing methods in NLP are not suf-
ficient to debias models end-to-end for many ap-
plications. We note the following limitations of
current approaches. First, the majority of debi-
asing techniques focus on a single, modular pro-
cess of an end-to-end NLP system. It remains to
be discovered how these individual parts harmo-
nize together to form an ideally unbiased system.
Second, most gender debiasing methods have only
been empirically verified in limited applications
(Zhang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2017), and it is not
clear that these methods can generalize to other
tasks or models. Third, we note that certain debi-
asing techniques may introduce noise into a NLP
model, causing performance degradation. Finally,

hand-craft debiasing approaches may unintention-
ally encode the implicit bias of the developers.

Below, we identify a few future directions.

Mitigating Gender Bias in Languages Beyond
English. With few exceptions (Vanmassenhove
et al., 2018; Prates et al., 2018), prior work has
focused on mitigating gender bias in the English
language. Future work can look to apply existing
methods or devise new techniques towards mit-
igating gender bias in other languages as well.
However, such a task is not trivial. Methods such
as gender-swapping are relatively easy in English
because English does not distinguish gender lin-
guistically. However, in languages such as Span-
ish, each noun has its own gender and correspond-
ing modifiers of the noun need to align with the
gender of the noun. To perform gender-swapping
in such languages, besides swapping those gen-
dered nouns, we also need to change the modifiers.

Non-Binary Gender Bias. With few exceptions
(Manzini et al., 2019), work on debiasing in NLP
has assumed that the protected attribute being dis-
criminated against is binary. Non-binary genders
(Richards et al., 2016) as well as racial biases have
largely been ignored in NLP and should be consid-
ered in future work.

Interdisciplinary Collaboration. As mentioned
in Section 1, gender bias is not a problem that is
unique to NLP; other fields in computer science
such as data mining, machine learning, and secu-
rity also study gender bias (Calders and Verwer,
2010; Feldman et al., 2015; Hardt et al., 2016;
Misra et al., 2016; Kleinberg et al., 2016; Pleiss
et al., 2017; Beutel et al., 2017; Kilbertus et al.,
2017). Many of these technical methods could be
applicable to NLP yet to our knowledge have not
been studied.

Additionally, mitigating gender bias in NLP is
both a sociological and an engineering problem.
To completely debias effectively, it is important
to understand how machine learning methods
encode biases and how humans perceive bi-
ases. A few interdisciplinary studies (Herbelot
et al., 2012; Avin et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2016;
Schluter, 2018) have emerged, and we urge more
interdisciplinary discussions in terms of gender
bias. Approaches from other technical fields may
improve current debiasing methods in NLP or
inspire the development of new, more effective
methods even if the properties of the data or


problem are different across fields. Discussions
between computer scientists and sociologists
may improve understanding of latent gender bias
found in machine learning data sets and model
predictions.
