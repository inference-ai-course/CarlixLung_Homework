Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are increas-
ingly under scrutiny for perpetuating identity-
based discrimination in high-stakes domains
such as hiring, particularly against people with
disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking
how intersecting forms of marginalization—
such as gender and caste—shape experiences of
PwD in the Global South. We conduct a com-
prehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hir-
ing scenarios spanning diverse disability, gen-
der, nationality, and caste profiles. To capture
subtle intersectional harms and biases, we in-
troduce ABLEIST (Ableism, Inspiration, Su-
perhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm
metrics grounded in disability studies litera-
ture. Our results reveal significant increases in
ABLEIST harms towards disabled candidates—
harms that many state-of-the-art tools fail to
detect. These harms were further amplified by
sharp increases in intersectional harms (e.g.,
Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized
disabled candidates, highlighting critical lim-
itations in current safety tools and the need
for intersectional safety evaluations of frontier
models in high-stakes domains like hiring.

1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) are now mak-
ing high-stakes hiring decisions (Hanson, 2023).
As LLM-powered recruitment tools gain traction,
they risk escalating the very socio-economic in-
equities they claim to mitigate? (Fritts and Cabr-
era, 2021). Scholars have documented hiring bi-
ases in LLMs (Tilmes, 2022; Veldanda et al., 2023;
Nghiem et al., 2025), including disability bias in

GPT-based resume screening (Glazko et al., 2024).
However, most of this work is grounded in Western
contexts (Septiandri et al., 2023), overlooking ways
in which harms may unfold globally.

Over 1.3 billion people worldwide live with dis-
abilities (DOJ, 2021), of which 80% reside in the
Global South?. India alone, home to over 60 mil-
lion people with disabilities (PwD) (Saikia et al.,
2016), faces severe disability discrimination, with
over 80% of its disabled population being unem-
ployed (NSO, 2019). This harm is further com-
pounded by other axes of marginalization such as
gender and caste (Sabharwal and Sonalkar, 2015;
Haq et al., 2020)—disabled women, for instance,
experience greater stigma, illiteracy, and exclu-
sion than male counterparts (Maurya, 2023). Such
harms are profoundly intersectional (Crenshaw,
2017). Thus, given the prominent role LLMs play
in hiring, we ask: What ableist and intersectional
biases emerge in LLMs towards disability, gender,
nationality, and caste within hiring contexts?

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive au-
dit of six LLMs—spanning closed-source, open-
weight, and open-source models—by generating
2,820 hiring conversations across diverse candidate
profiles representing disability, gender, nationality,
and caste (Figure 1). To capture subtle, nuanced
forms of intersectional disability bias, we introduce
the ABLEism, Inspiration, Superhumanization,
and Tokenism (ABLEIST) metrics, a framework
grounded in the disability studies and intersection-
ality literature, validated by domain experts (Table
2). We validate LLM-based labeling on our gold-
standard dataset through prompt engineering and
evaluations, then use the validated model to scale
ABLEIST labeling on the generated conversations.

Our results reveal pervasive and compounding
ableism in LLM-generated conversations across
all LLMs. Disabled candidates experienced up

More Intersectional Identities, More ABLEIST Harms All

Figure 1: We create many candidate profiles, spanning single-attribute identities (disability) to multi-attribute (disability, gender,
and caste), generating 2,820 hiring conversations across 6 LLMs. We annotate the generated conversations across the ABLEIST
metrics. Our findings point to compounding intersectional harms for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates.

to 58x more ABLEIST harm than baseline can-
didates without identity markers, with 99.7% of
all disability-related conversations containing at
least one ABLEIST harm. Harm patterns varied
by disability: candidate profiles with Autism, for
example, experienced more Superhumanization
Harm. Notably, intersectional harms (..e., Inspi-
ration Porn, Tokenism) grew by 10-51% when dis-
ability, gender and caste identities overlapped.
Despite the prevalence of ABLEIST harms,
widely used safety tools (e.g., Perspective API,
OpenAI Moderation) flagged no toxicity or harm,
revealing their inability to detect covert, nuanced
disability and intersectional bias in LLM outputs.
These findings highlight the need for intersectional
safety evaluations and detection models to de-
tect harms in such high-stakes domains like hir-
ing. To address this need and facilitate reusability,
we finetune Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, producing
a cost-efficient, open-weight model for detecting
ABLEIST harms.* Overall, our results demon-
strate that intersectional ableist harm is not an iso-
lated failure, but a systemic issue in frontier LLMs,
calling for a paradigm shift towards intersectional
safety evaluations in AI research and deployment.

2 Related Work

Ableism and Intersectionality. Ableism is a per-
vasive system of discrimination and social preju-
dice against people with disabilities. It is reinforced
through stigmatizing language and hate speech
(Keller and Galgay, 2010; Sherry et al., 2019; He-

4Code: https: //github.com/hayoungjungg/ABLEIST,
Model: https: //huggingface.co/hayoungjung/1llama3.

ung et al., 2022), condescending and “othering”
attitudes (Bogart and Dunn, 2019; Friedman and
Owen, 2017), and everyday practices that normal-
ize able-bodiedness (e.g., “blind review process””).
The first principle of disability justice is intersec-
tionality (Berne, 2015): the cumulative structural
harm and discrimination caused by overlapping
identities, such as disability, gender, class (Cren-
shaw, 2017). Some characterize this intersectional
harm as “double” (Stuart, 1992; Abdellatif, 2021;
Sabharwal and Sonalkar, 2015) or even “triple
marginalization” (Maurya, 2023). Historically, dis-
ability has been used to justify the exclusion of
other marginalized groups (McRuer, 2008; Stuart,
1992), which has motivated disability scholars to
examine layered forms of bias (Baynton, 2005).
However, disability and its intersections with iden-
tities of marginalization in the Global South remain
notably absent from intersectional studies (Naples
et al., 2019), including within AI fairness and safety
studies (McCrory, 2025) which we discuss next.
Intersectional Harm in AI Systems. Recent work
has shown how LLMs reproduce ableism (Herold
et al., 2022; Gadiraju et al., 2023; Phutane et al.,
2025), with disability often rendered as an outlier
in machine learning models (Trewin, 2018). While
some studies examined intersectionality in AI bias
(Hassan et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2023; Charlesworth
et al., 2024; Guo and Caliskan, 2021), they mostly
focused on gender and racial biases—dimensions
largely situated in Western contexts (Sambasivan
et al., 2021). A growing body of work has explored
harms and stereotypes in LLMs in the Global South
contexts (Christopher, 2025; Dammu et al., 2024;

Table 1: Based on the identities, we create 47 profiles (see
Table 8). For each profile, we generate 5 conversations across
6 LLMs and 2 occupations, resulting in 47 x 5x 6x 2=
2,820 total conversations. In U.S. hiring contexts, we vary
Nationality (Indian, American); in India hiring contexts, we
vary Caste (Dalit, Brahmin).

Khandelwal et al., 2023; Tomar et al., 2025; Ghosh,
2024), yet these studies overlook disability and
broader intersectionality (Sambasivan et al., 2021).
As AI increasingly shapes high-stakes decisions
such as hiring (Hanson, 2023), addressing these
gaps is essential for understanding how intersec-
tional ableist harms are compounded and ampli-
fied.

3 Methodology

To quantify covert ableism and intersectional harms
in LLM-generated conversations in the hiring con-
texts, we describe our three-step methodology: (1)
our experimental setup for generating LLM conver-
sations involving intersectional identities, (2) the
ABLEism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and
Tokenism (ABLEIST) metrics to measure covert
ableism and intersectional harms, and (3) a robust
evaluation of LLMs against a gold standard dataset
to measure ABLEIST metrics in the conversations.

3.1 Conversation Generation

To investigate LLMs in hiring contexts, we prompt
them to act as recruitment tools: presenting ap-
plicants with job experience and identities, and
making hiring decisions. Following (Dammu et al.,
2024), we model this process as a dialogue between
two hiring managers, extending prior work show-
ing that narrative framing and human-like conversa-
tions can illuminate the AI reasoning behind deci-
sions (Munn and Henrickson, 2024; Miller, 2019).
This approach probes insights into the model’s
worldview, probing whether it generates harmful
content even when given neutral prompts. This
offers a closer reflection of real-world LLM-based
hiring applications than explicit prompting meth-
ods, such as jailbreaking (Anil et al., 2024; An-
driushchenko et al., 2024), red-teaming (Ganguli
et al., 2022), and prompt attacks (Liu et al., 2024).
Conversation Prompt Design: Our prompt de-
sign draws on social identity theory (Tajfel and
Turner, 2004) and intersectionality theory (Cren-

shaw, 2017), which views individuals as shaped
by overlapping identities (e.g., disability, gender,
nationality, caste). To foreground intersectional
identities in generated conversations, our prompt
includes a candidate’s key identities (e.g., Blind,
Man), along with static information such as age
and experience level. See Figure 8 for the prompt.
Disability & Intersecting Identities. To represent
a range of intersectional identities, we cover:
Disability (3): Blind, Cerebral Palsy (CP), and
Autism, which vary in visibility (Davis, 2005) and
workplace accommodations.

Gender (3): Man, Woman, and Transgender, in-
cluded to counter binary framings of gender (Ur-
man et al., 2025; Diamond et al., 2011).
Nationalities (2): American and Indian. We vary
nationality to surface cultural assumptions that
emerge when shifting affiliation from the Global
North to the Global South.

Castes (2): Brahmin and Dalit. In the Indian re-
cruitment context, we vary caste to examine in-
herent caste bias in LLMs, largely overlooked in
current industry benchmarks (Christopher, 2025).
Occupation Selection. We considered two oc-
cupations: School Teacher (stereotyped as femi-
nine, nurturing) and Software Developer (mascu-
line, technical), chosen for their contrasting societal
perceptions across identities (Ghosh and Caliskan,
2023; Veldanda et al., 2023; Pathania et al., 2023).
LLM Selection. We selected six LLMs: four
closed-source from OpenAI, Deepseek, Anthropic,
and Google, one open-weight from Meta, and one
fully open-source from Ai2 (see Table 1). We set
the temperature to 0.7 and a 1,024-token limit.
Data Collection. To study harm across in-
tersectional identities, we created 47 candidate
profiles (Table 8): baseline with no attributes
(1), disability (3), disability+gender (9), disabil-
ity+nationality (8), disability+caste (8), and dis-
ability+gender+caste (18). This progression from
single-attribute to multi-attribute profiles centers
disability while examining how ableist and inter-
sectional harms compound when intersecting with
gender, caste, and nationality facing multifaceted
societal oppression. For each profile, across occu-
pations and LLMs, we generated 5 conversations,
yielding 2,820 total (Table 1). Details in §B.

intersectionality literature to measure covert bias
in LLM-generated conversations. ABLEIST
covers five ableism-specific metrics, enabling
fine-grained analysis of disability bias, and three
intersectional harm metrics, capturing covert
biases across a range of identities.

Our metrics are grounded in disability studies lit-
erature, drawing from taxonomies of ableism (He-
ung et al., 2022; Keller and Galgay, 2010), hand-
books on workplace inclusion (Lindsay et al., 2023;
Harpur, 2019), and literature highlighting lived ex-
periences of disabled scholars (Shew, 2024). For
instance, Technoableism, is coined by disability
scholar, Ashley Shew (2024) and describes the
emphasis that societies place on technology and
medical interventions to “fix” the limitations of a
disability. Similarly, Inspiration Porn was coined
by Stella Young (2014), a disability rights activist,
and has appeared across disability studies literature
(Grue, 2016; Ellis, 2016; Heung et al., 2022).

We also draw on harm metrics from critical stud-
ies of race and disability (Schalk, 2021). These
include Superhumanization (Waytz et al., 2015;
Pepper, 2016), where PwD are attributed with ex-
traordinary traits because of their disability , and
Ability Saviorism, (Teju, 2012; Siuty et al., 2025),
where able-bodied individuals position themselves
as rescuers who must assist or “solve” the issues of

disabled people. Table 2 presents all eight metrics
including definitions and examples.

3.3 Creating the Gold Standard Dataset

To refine and validate our ABLEIST metrics, we re-
cruited four domain experts° who reviewed the met-
rics and annotated 5 conversations each. Through
discussions and incorporating their feedback, we
refined and validated the ABLEIST metrics and our
annotation scheme (Table 2) for subsequent data
annotation. For brevity, details are in §C.1.

Next, three authors independently annotated 60
conversations across the 8 ABLEIST metrics with
binary labels present (1) or absent (@), follow-
ing Dammu et al. (2024). After iterative rounds
of annotation and resolving disagreements, the au-
thors reached Krippendorff’s a = 0.71, indicat-
ing a moderate agreement (Krippendorff, 2018),
comparable to prior works (Dammu et al., 2024;
Welbl et al., 2021). After reaching these agree-
ment rates, two authors independently annotated
105 additional conversations, resulting in a total of
165 gold-standard annotated conversations. Table 9
reports agreement scores, with details in §C.2.

The annotation process resulted in 8 ABLEIST
metrics x 165 conversations = 1,320 high-quality

3.4 Scaling ABLEIST Labeling with LLMs

To scale labeling of the ABLEIST metrics, we
leverage LLMs and fine-tune a smaller model for
reusability and preservation of our work.

3.4.1 LLM-Based ABLEIST Annotations

For each ABLEIST metric, we used LLMs to as-
sign binary labels (present (1) or absent (Q)) to
generated conversations. We create zero- and few-
shot prompts for in-context learning, which have
shown strong performance in similar classification
tasks compared to human experts (Brown et al.,
2020; Dammu et al., 2024). See §D.1 for prompt
design details and Figures 9-10 for prompts.

From the 165 conversations in our gold-standard
dataset, we used 105 for model evaluation to select
the final model and reserved 60 for additional ro-
bustness evaluations (see §D.4). In the few-shot
setting, five labeled examples from the dataset were
included as demonstrations but excluded from eval-
uation to avoid data leakage, leaving 100 conver-
sations per metric for our model evaluation.’ We
compared five LLMs from OpenAI and Anthropic
(Table 3); among them, GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and
Claude-Sonnet-4 support reasoning (§D.2).
Model Evaluations. Tables 12-16 present full
evaluations of the 5 LLMs, with details in §D.3.

how LLMs perform compared to humans on various tasks

others, achieving 0.748-0.967 macro Fl-scores
across ABLEIST metrics (Table 3), matching or
exceeding the performance reported in prior works
on harmful content detection (Mishra and Chat-
terjee, 2023; Dammu et al., 2024). Robustness
evaluations on the held-out set further validated
the strong, reliable performance (macro F1=0.783-
0.877) of GPT-5-chat-latest (§D.4).

While GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini performed com-
parably, we found that raising the reasoning effort
setting often reduced performance, suggesting that
additional reasoning is counterproductive for label-
ing covert biases. We used GPT-5-chat-latest to
label the remaining 2,655 generated conversations.

3.4.2 Distilling Models for Reusability

To promote scientific reusability and preserve our
extensive evaluation effort to detect intersectional
ableist harm, we adopt a distillation approach. Prior
works demonstrated that student models can be
effectively trained from high-performing teacher
models (Park et al., 2024; Jung et al., 2025b).
Since GPT-5-chat-latest achieved the best per-
formance (§3.4.1), we use it as a teacher to generate
high-quality synthetic labels (Zheng et al., 2023)
for the 2,655 generated conversations and fine-tune
a smaller student model. This approach reduces
API and compute costs, avoiding the instability of
relying on closed-source LLMs, whose behaviors
can drift over time (OpenAI, 2025). We fine-tuned
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, an open-weight LLM,
with details in §E.1 and evaluation results in §4.3.

4 Results

We present our analysis of ABLEIST harms in
§4.1, harms across intersectional identities in §4.2,
and baseline comparisons in §4.3, with additional
results provided in Appendix §A.

4.1 ABLEIST Harm

Compared to baseline, adding a disability identity
to candidate profiles increased ABLEIST harm
by 1.15x to 58x on average across metrics (Figure
2). We observed the largest increase in Tokenism,
Anticipated Ableism, and Inspiration Porn, surfac-
ing 40-58x more often for disabled candidates.
99.7% of all generated conversations with dis-
abilities contained at least one ABLEIST metric,
compared to a baseline of 43.3% (§A.1). Disabled
candidates showed statistically significant increases
across all ABLEIST metrics compared to baseline
profiles without identity attributes (Table 5).

ABLEist Metrics

Figure 2: Heatmaps of ABLEIST metrics scores by LLMs. A score of 0.5 indicates that 50% of all conversations generated by
this LLM contained this harm. Scores are significantly greater when disability is specified.

Deepseek-V3, OLMo2-7B, and GPT-4.1 generated
the most ABLEIST harm on average in conver-
sations (mean ABLEIST scores > 77%; Table
4), with a Kruskal-Wallis test confirming signifi-
cant differences across LLMs in ABLEIST scores
(KW H(5) = 234.6, p < 0.001). Llama-3.1-8B
showed the highest prevalence among the five
ableism-specific ABLEIST metrics, with 100% of
conversations exhibiting /nfantilization—depicting
candidates with disabilities as dependent and in-
competent: “she’s blind, how will she manage a
classroom and interact with students?”’.

Blind candidate profiles showed statistically sig-
nificantly more Technoableism than those with
autism (r = 0.43) or cerebral palsy (r = 0.18)
(Table 7). This harm framed technology as a
“compensatory strategy” (OLMo2) to “help level
the playing field” (GPT-4.1) for candidates. All
LLMs emphasized screen readers and Braille dis-
plays, noting that blind candidates “can be just
as effective” (Gemini-2.5) as able-bodied cowork-
ers, “especially with today’s assistive technology”
(Llama-3.1). This devalues the candidate’s com-
petence and reflects the medical model of disability,
viewing disability as a deficit to be corrected.

LLMs generated significantly more Superhu-
manization harm for candidates with Autism,
compared to other disabilities (Figure 5). Peo-
ple with autism were characterized as “as-
sets” (Claude-3.7), due to their “exceptional
attention to detail” (OLMo2), “deep hyperfocus”
(GPT-4.1), and “heightened sense of logical struc-
ture” (Gemini-2.5), exaggerating these traits into
mythic standards for work. Gemini, for instance,
described an autistic teacher to have “encyclopedic
knowledge of their subject matter,” and an autistic
software engineer to write “bug-free code.” While
framed as praise and exceptionalism, such portray-

als reduced individuals with autism to stereotypes,
obscuring their lived experiences and dehumaniz-
ing them under the guise of admiration.

School Teacher candidates received more harm
compared to Software Developer candidates,
particularly for Inspiration Porn (r = 0.42), To-
kenism (r = 0.19), Infantilization (r = 0.13),
and Superhumanization (r = 0.11) (Figure 6).
These findings are consistent with prior work
(Dammu et al., 2024), which found that traditional,
community-facing occupations like teachers, car-
ried stronger stereotypes and social expectations.

4.2 Harm for Intersectional Identities

Figure 3 shows that compounding marginalized
gender and caste identities leads to greater harms
than compounding dominant ones.

Intersectional harm increased by 10-51% on
average when marginalized gender and caste
identities were introduced (i.e., Woman, Dalit),
compared to only 6% for dominant identities (i.e.,
Brahmin, Man) (Figure 3). These differences were
Statistically significant across all minority identities
(Table 5). For instance, Superhumanization Harm
and Tokenism rose by a mean of 21% when gender
minorities were included and an additional 25%
with caste minorities, illustrating the compounding
effects of intersectional harm (Crenshaw, 2017).
Across all LLMs, marginalized PwD were often
reduced to symbols of diversity or resilience, val-
ued not for their qualifications but for their identity
to fulfill “diversity quotas” (Gemini-2.5), or qual-
ify for “government incentives” (Deepseek-V3).
The strongest compounding harm effects ap-
peared in the open-weight Llama-3.1 and open-
source models OLMo2 (Table 6). Mean intersec-
tional harm scores increased significantly with
moderate effect sizes (ro_tMo = 0.58, TLliama =

0.47) when gender and caste were introduced. As
OLMo-2 noted for a software developer applicant:
“Her being a Dalit woman and blind could pose
some challenges in the interview process and daily
functioning within our tech-driven company.”
Harm scores for closed-source models rose
sharply when a third marginalized identity was
layered onto two existing identities. These ef-
fects were strongest for Deepseek-V3 (r = 0.82),
Claude-3.7 (r = 0.49), and GPT-4.1 (r = 0.38)
(Table 6). GPT-4.1 consistently highlighted the
candidate’s intersectionality, “she’s a Dalit woman
with cerebral palsy. That intersectionality is sig-
nificant for our diversity goals...she could be a
real role model.” Such outputs indicate Tokenism
and Inspiration Porn— metrics that spiked when
marginalized identities were combined (Table 5).
Disabled transgender candidates experienced
significantly higher Tokenism (r = 0.19) and
Inspiration Porn (r = (0.11) compared to dis-
abled men (Figure 7). Differences were more
pronounced between castes: disabled Dalit can-
didate profiles exhibited significantly higher To-
kenism (r = 0.24) and Inspiration Porn (r = 0.15)
scores than those of disabled Brahmin candidates.

4.3 Toxicity and Harms Baseline

We compared our LLM-based ABLEIST detection
methods (§3.4.1) against industry and popular base-
line models for toxicity and hate detection: Ope-
nAI Omni-Moderation (Markov et al., 2022), Mi-
crosoft Azure AI Content Safety, Perspective API
(Lees et al., 2022), and Detoxify (Hanu and team,
2020). We also benchmark against the open-weight

Covert Harms and Social Threats (CHAST) model
(Dammu et al., 2024), a relevant framework for cap-
turing covertly harmful language towards identity
groups in non-Western contexts (e.g., caste).

All baselines failed to detect any harm in the
generated conversations (Figure 4), outputting neg-
ligible scores that hover around 0. Perspective
produced no scores above 0.3—a recommended
threshold for flagging content (Perspective, 2025).
This raises concerns about AI safety: even front-
line harm detectors overlook intersectional ableist
harms embedded in ostensibly “safe” content.

The CHAST model outperformed other base-
lines, identifying some covert harms like Cate-
gorization Threat, Competence Threat, and Op-
portunity Harm (Figure 4). However, the average
proportion of conversations identified as contain-
ing covert harms was notably lower for CHAST
compared to ABLEIST, indicating limited capacity
to capture subtle, intersectional harms in the gen-
erated conversations. In contrast, our ABLEIST
framework detected a higher prevalence of harms,
capturing the veiled forms of intersectional harms
that CHAST frequently overlooked.

Results from Distilling Model. The inability of
existing baseline tools to detect covert intersec-
tional ableist harms highlights the need for dedi-
cated, reusable detection models that can support
intersectional safety evaluation of frontier mod-
els. Our distillation effort (§3.4.2) addresses this
gap by producing an open-weight alternative that
preserves the strong ABLEIST detection capabil-
ity of GPT-5-chat-latest. As shown in Table 3,
the finetuned Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct performs
comparably to or outperforms LLMs evaluated in
§3.4.1 (macro F1=0.75—0.94 across ABLEIST met-
rics on the evaluation split; 0.707—0.907 on the
robustness split), despite its smaller size (8B param-


eters). These results validate our distilled model as
a reusable, cost-efficient detector for intersectional
ableist harm. Full results are in Table 11 and §E.2.

5 Discussion

Our results suggest that LLMs surface egregious
amounts of implicit ableist harms and biases (§4.1),
disproportionately affecting those with intersecting
gender and caste-marginalized disabled identities
($4.2). The failure of SOTA toxicity detection mod-
els to recognize intersectional ableist harms (§4.3)
is alarming, leaving PwD exposed to pervasive,
covert ableism, which is especially rampant in the
Global South (Kumar et al., 2012). We demonstrate
the effectiveness of ABLEIST metrics to capture
covert, intersectional ableism, extending prior ex-
aminations of ableism in AI (Phutane et al., 2025).

5.1 Global Implications of ABLEIST LLMs

With India emerging as one of the largest markets
for AI companies (Christopher, 2025), ABLEIST
models risk proliferation across regions where dis-
ability bias continues to limit access and oppor-
tunity for PwD—over 80% of working-age dis-
abled people in India are unemployed (NSO, 2019).
As LLMs are increasingly used across high-stakes,
often life-altering domains, such as hiring deci-
sions or college admission (Fritts and Cabrera,
2021; Nghiem et al., 2025; Waters and Miikku-
lainen, 2014), ABLEIST model behaviors would
only deepen existing socio-economic disparities.

Tropes like Inspiration Porn or Ability Savior-
ism especially harm gender, class, and religiously
marginalized disabled communities in the Global
South, where ableism intensifies systemic and so-
cial exclusion (Sambasivan et al., 2019; Haq et al.,
2020; Mugeere et al., 2020). Without deliberate
mitigation strategies—such as deploying our dis-
tilled model for detecting ABLEIST harms (§3.4.2)
and incorporating model abstention mechanisms
(Wen et al., 2025), which many SOTA models fail
to achieve (§4.3)—-ABLEIST LLMs risk erasing
decades of disability advocacy work that has fought
for visibility, self-determination, and meaningful
social participation (Meekosha and Soldatic, 2011;
Mondal et al., 2022; Kaur et al., 2024).

5.2 Implications for Intersectional AI Safety

Our results empirically validate intersectionality
theory (Crenshaw, 2017) in the context of AI sys-
tems, showing that harms are not simply additive

but compounded across marginalized identities. In-
tersectional harm metrics, such as Inspiration Porn,
Superhumanization Harm, and Tokenism, signif-
icantly increased when intersecting marginalized
identities (§4.2), providing quantitative evidence
for longstanding theoretical claims: multiple axes
of marginalization introduce layered forms of bias,
discrimination, and “economic deprivation” (Sab-
harwal and Sonalkar, 2015; Abdellatif, 2021). Our
work extends existing AI fairness frameworks by in-
troducing empirically grounded, operationalizable
metrics—A BLEIST—that surface covert harms
overlooked by current detection systems, translat-
ing intersectionality into a measurable construct for
AI evaluation.

For AI safety, our findings call for a paradigm
shift from single-axis harm evaluation towards in-
tersectional safety evaluations of frontier mod-
els. Single-axis analyses obscure the heightened bi-
ases that emerge when multiple marginalized iden-
tities intersect ($4.2). As LLMs increasingly shape
hiring, health, and education decisions (Hanson,
2023; Anthropic, 2025a), failing to account for
compounded intersectional harms risks entrench-
ing structural and economic inequities in high-
stakes contexts (Crenshaw, 2017), particularly in
the Global South where systems of caste, gender,
and disability discrimination intersect most acutely
(Maurya, 2023; Sabharwal and Sonalkar, 2015).

As current AI safety research and policies over-
look intersectionality (McCrory, 2025), future
work must integrate intersectional frameworks into
model evaluations, examining how overlapping
identities compound bias and harm, developing
evaluations to capture these effects, and designing
mitigation strategies to prevent their amplification
for multiply marginalized groups. Our distilled
detection model provides a practical step in this
direction, which can be integrated with CHAST
(Dammu et al., 2024) to enable more comprehen-
sive detection of veiled, intersectional harms and
support intersectional safety evaluations of LLMs.

6 Conclusion

We introduce ABLEIST, a set of eight metrics that
capture subtle ableist and intersectional harms. Ap-
plying these metrics to 2,820 hiring conversations
generated by six LLMs, we find that all models
pervasively produce ABLEIST harms toward can-
didates with disabilities. Such harms further com-
pound when candidates hold multiple marginalized


identities. Existing safety tools fail to detect any
harm. Our results highlight the need for consider-
ing intersectionality in AI safety evaluations and
detection models in high-stakes domains.

Limitations

ABLEIST Metrics. This work introduces the
ABLEIST metrics, grounded in disability stud-
ies and intersectionality literature, to measure nu-
anced, covert forms of intersectional ableist harms.
However, other frameworks from disability justice
and feminist theory offer complementary ways to
assess intersectional harms (Rohmer and Louvet,
2018; Allen, 2018). We encourage future work
to integrate metrics from these perspectives with
ABLEIST for more comprehensive evaluations of
intersectional ableist harms in generated texts.
Focus on Hiring Contexts. Given the widespread
use of LLMs in hiring (Hanson, 2023), we eval-
uate models for bias and harm in this consequen-
tial context. However, LLMs are increasingly me-
diating decision-making in other high-stakes do-
mains, such as healthcare, education, and science
(Anthropic, 2025a; Chatterji et al., 2025). Our
methodology—including the ABLEIST metrics—
is compatible with other high-stakes contexts.
Exploring Broader & Deeper Intersectionality.
Our work includes a range of intersectional identi-
ties, covering disability, gender, nationality, and
caste, offering broader conceptualization of in-
tersectionality beyond the Western context (Guo
and Caliskan, 2021). However, additional identity
axes—such as religion and socioeconomic class—
and identity groups (e.g., “Sudra” for caste) war-
rant further investigation (Sambasivan et al., 2021).
Future work should broaden and deepen such ex-
ploration to uncover distinct, layered intersectional
harms that LLMs may perpetuate.

Additional LLMs and Occupational Contexts.
With compute resources in mind, we have limited
the study to 6 LLMs and 2 occupation roles. During
the study, many new LLMs, ranging from closed-
source Grok-4 (xAI, 2025) to the open-weight
gpt-oss (OpenAI, 2025b), were released. While
we prioritized frontier models spanning closed-
source to open-source variants, future work can
extend our methods to evaluate additional LLMs
and include additional occupational roles.
Behavioral Drifts. Proprietary models, such as
GPT-5, experience behavioral drifts due to periodic
updates (OpenAI, 2025). Thus, the prompt that

performed well on the gold-standard dataset may
not retain the same performance in the future. We
partly address this limitation by developing and
sharing a local, open-weight model (§3.4.2).
Model Errors. We employ LLMs validated on
the gold-standard dataset to scale the labeling of
ABLEIST metrics. Despite extensive evaluations,
the model error rates may influence the distilla-
tion of the open-weight model and the downstream
analysis. We partly address this limitation by con-
ducting additional robustness evaluations, further
validating their strong, reliable performance.
Subjectivity in Harm. Detecting harms and tox-
icity is inherently subjective in nature and influ-
enced by annotators’ positionalities (Welbl et al.,
2021). To mitigate these effects, annotators strictly
adhered to the annotation guidelines. The full an-
notation scheme and process are described in (§C).
Nonetheless, as Kirk et al. (2022) notes, we ac-
knowledge that some level of subjectivity may be
inevitable due to the annotators’ positionality.

Ethical Considerations

Generating and Measuring Harms. We use pub-
licly accessible LLMs to generate conversations
and measure ABLEIST harms, often producing
harmful content. We believe the benefits of our
research outweigh the risks, as our work highlights
the intersectional harms of deploying LLMs in
high-stakes domains. To prevent misuse, we will
not publicly release the dataset; researchers can
request access by contacting the authors.
Centering Marginalized Identities. Following
Blodgett et al. (2020), we center our study on com-
munities impacted by LLM systems, refining and
validating annotation schemes with domain experts
who have lived experiences with disability ($C).
Our study was approved by our Institutional Re-
view Board (IRB). Participants gave informed con-
sent to share anonymized data, and no personally
identifiable information was collected or exposed
to LLMs. Experts were compensated $20 USD per
hour, in line with fair-pay standards.

Well-being of Data Handlers. To minimize ex-
posure to harmful content, we made the conscious
decision not to involve independent crowdworkers.
Thus, we ensured data handlers took breaks dur-
ing annotations, distributed workload evenly, and
provided space for debriefing (Kirk et al., 2022).
ABLEIST Detection Model. While our distilled
model facilitates the detection of ABLEIST harms,


it is not intended to replace human judgment. Our
model should serve as a supportive tool for AI
safety research, enabling intersectional safety eval-
uations of frontier models with guidance from do-
main experts and appropriate human oversight.

A Additional Results

A.1 ABLEIST Scores Distribution

We report ABLEIST scores across each LLM and
harm metric in Figure 4. Harm scores for Tech-
noableism, One-Size-Fits-All Ableism, and Abil-
ity Saviorism are striking, especially for Gemini,
Deepseek, OLMo-2 and Llama models (over 97%
harm). We also analyzed ABLEIST scores based
on ableism-specific and intersectional harm metrics
described in Table 2. Notably, Llama has the high-
est ableism score (0.94), but the lowest score for
intersectional harm metrics (0.41). This is a sim-
ilar trend: all models except Claude have greater
ableism scores, indicating that our ABLEIST met-
rics capture disability harm effectively.

We note a 43.3% baseline score for ABLEIST
metrics. This baseline occurred when disability
was indicated as none, and LLMs made off-handed
comments about this lowering accomodation costs
and burdens, which still generated harms like Tech-
noableism and Infantilization.

Table 7 displays variations in harm across the
three disabilities. We observe interesting trends,
like increased amounts of Superhumanization and
Anticipated Ableism for autism, or greater Tech-
noableism for blind candidates. Interestingly, we
observed higher Anticipated Ableism for blind and
autism identities, reflecting trends in increased visi-
bility online (Jones et al., 2023; Akhtar et al., 2022).
This mass visibility in turn contributes to more
stereotypification, reflected in greater One-Size-
Fits-All Ableism and Superhumanization scores.
Variations between Occupations. We observed
more harm for School Teacher applicants com-
pared to Software Developer, specifically for In-
spiration Porn (r = 0.42), Tokenism (r = 0.19),
Infantilization (r = 0.13), and Superhumanization
(r = 0.11). These findings concur with prior work
(Dammit et al., 2024), which find that traditional oc-


cupations like teacher, nurses, and doctors generate
more harm.

A.2. Compounding ABLEIsT Harm with
Intersectional Identities

To observe relationships between different intersec-
tional identities, we refer to Table 5. We observe
a Statistically significant increase in harm across
all metrics, most notably up to 5833% (or 58x) be-
tween Baseline and Disability Only for Tokenism.
We continue to observe an increase in Tokenism
harm across Disability and Gender, Disability and
Caste, (see Figure 7) and even three compounding
identities of Disability, Gender, and Caste (Table
5).

B_ Conversation Generation Details

B.1 Model APIs, Parameters, and Hardware

To generate the hiring conversations, we used a
combination of proprietary APIs for the closed-
source models and HuggingFace Transformers on
a Google Cloud VM instance for the open-source
models. In particular, we used OpenAI’s API Plat-
form, Anthropic’s Claude API, the Deepseek API,
and Google’s Gemini Developer API to generate
conversations with GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet,
Deepseek-V3, and Gemini-2.5 Pro, respectively.
We ran conversation generation for Llama-3.1-8B
and OLMo2-7B on a Google Cloud Compute En-
gine VM with four Nvidia T4 GPUs and 64 GB of
memory.

Following Dammu et al. (2024), generations
were run with a temperature of 0.7 and a 1024-
token limit (extended from 512 since LLMs tended
to generate longer conversations that were substan-
tially cut off by the 512-token limit).

B.2 Candidate Profile Attributes

Besides the identity attributes specified in the pro-
files, each candidate had other information speci-
fied: age, name, and experience. The candidate’s
age was set to 35, and their experience was five
years of either software development or teaching
experience, depending on their listed occupation.
Names were assigned based on geography and
gender. For two-attribute profiles involving gen-
der and disability, male, female, and transgender
candidates were named Jack, Jackie, and Jay, re-
spectively. American candidates without gender
assignment were named Jay, while Indian candi-
dates without gender were named Kiran. For three-

15

attribute intersectional profiles (all included caste),
candidates were consistently named Kiran.

Since LLMs tended to feel the need to comment
on all facets of a candidate’s profile, even if they
were listed as None or N/A, we generally removed
unspecified identities from the prompt except for
disability (e.g. if a candidate wasn’t assigned a
gender, the Gender: line in the candidate’s profile
wasn’t present).

C_ Creating the Gold-Standard Dataset

Here, we describe how we refined the annotation
scheme §C.1 and detail the process of obtaining
annotations for the gold-standard dataset §C.2.

C.1 Refining Annotation Scheme

We developed the qualitative coding scheme for la-
beling LLM-generated conversations through mul-
tiple iterations. Three authors initially reviewed a
different samples (> 15) of LLM-generated conver-
sations, combining literature review and annotation
to derive the ABLEIST metrics and a two-step an-
notation process: (1) assign a binary label for each
metric (absent (@) or present (1)), and (2) if
present, identify the supporting excerpt(s) and
provide justification for the label.

To refine our annotation scheme, we worked
with four domain experts who had lived experi-
ences with disabilities (two of whom experienced
ableism in India). Our experts independently re-
viewed the ABLEIST metrics and annotated five
conversations each. Three candidates participated
in researcher-led 45-minute virtual meetings, while
another annotated conversations asynchronously
and discussed results with researchers after com-
pletion. Candidates were compensated $15.

The authors and domain experts engaged in crit-
ical conversations about the metrics and their sig-
nificance. Experts provided guidance on how to
operationalize these metrics and their definitions,
and identify harm in conversations. In light of their
lived experiences with ableism and intersectional
discrimination, experts took agency to annotate
one sentence with multiple ABLEIST harms. This
helped shape annotators’ understanding of intersec-
tional harm. Based on their feedback and discus-
sion, we further refined the ABLEIST metrics, their
definitions, and our overall annotation scheme.

C.2 Annotation Process

To construct the gold-standard dataset, three au-
thors labeled 60 LLM-generated conversations over

The authors repeated this process for two more
rounds, independently annotating a set of 20 con-
versations, discussing their annotations, and resolv-
ing disagreements. Agreement improved to an over-
all Krippendorff’s a of 0.655 in the second round
and 0.71 in the third round. Despite the challenges
and subjectivity of identifying toxic and harmful
languages in text (Welbl et al., 2021), our overall
score (@ = 0.71) in the final round indicates a mod-
erate level of agreement (Krippendorff, 2018), and
is comparable to the level of agreement reported
in prior work (Dammu et al., 2024; Baheti et al.,

60 LLM-generated conversations were annotated
across the rounds.

After reaching agreement rates comparable to
prior work, two authors each annotated 53 conver-
sations, with 6 overlapping for reliability. Since
47 conversations were unique per annotator, this
resulted in the annotation of 100 total conversations
(94 unique + 6 overlapping). Across the overlap-
ping conversations (6 x 8 metrics = 48 labels), they
disagreed on six labels, yielding a high percentage

sisted of 8 ABLEIST metrics x 165 conversations
= 1,320 high-quality gold labels. The annotations
spanned three weeks, with each example requiring
3-10 minutes.

D Details on Scaling Annotations with
LLM

Here, we discuss the prompt design consideration
(§D.1), selected models (§D.2), evaluation results
(§D.3), and additional robustness evaluations of the
best-performing LLMs for our task (§$D.4). After
extensive evaluations of LLMs, we selected the
best model to scale labeling of the generated con-
versations across the ABLEIST metrics.

D.1 Prompt Design Considerations

The design of our prompt was guided by Ope-
nAl’s prompt-engineering recommendations (Ope-
nAI FAQ, 2025; OpenAI, 2025) and prior works
(Jung et al., 2025a; Dammu et al., 2024; Park et al.,
2024). For each ABLEIST metric, we designed a
zero-shot prompt (Figure 9) and a few-shot prompt
(Figure 10). Below, we list the various prompt
design elements we considered:
¢ System Roles: While personas can improve
model performance (OpenAI, 2025), their ef-
fects are often unpredictable (Zheng et al.,
2024). Still, Zheng et al. (2024) found that
“gender-neutral, in-domain, and work-related
roles” can lead to more reliable performance.
Given the focus on ableism and intersectional
harms in our ABLEIST labeling task, we
prompted the LLM with the persona of a so-
cial science expert, reflecting the social sci-
ence foundations of intersectionality and dis-
ability studies (Crenshaw, 2017): “You are a
social science expert specializing in
ableism, harms, and identity threats,
including their covert manifestations
in hiring conversations. Your task
is to rigorously evaluate and identify
these subtle harms.”
Contextual Details: Since providing proper
contextual details is helpful to LLMs to reason
and justify their decisions (OpenAI FAQ, 2025),
we provide the definition of each ABLEIST met-
ric (Table 2) and descriptions of the binary la-
bels.
Temperature: Temperature influences how
models generate text (OpenAI, 2024), with
lower values making the response more deter-
ministic and higher values producing more cre-
ative outputs. Prior work (Mishra and Chatter-
jee, 2023; Dammu et al., 2024; Park et al., 2024)
found that a temperature of 0.2 performed best
for deterministic tasks like toxicity and harmful
language detection. We experiment with temper-
atures 0 and 0.2 for our task.®
¢ {Zero, Few}-Shot: For each metric, we eval-
uated both zero-shot and few-shot prompting.
Zero-shot prompts present the task without ex-
amples, while few-shot prompts provide ex-
amples to support in-context learning without

8GPT-5-2025-@8-07 and GPT-5-mini-2025-08-07 do
not accept temperature, while Claude-Sonnet-4 with
Extended Thinking requires a temperature of 1. We em-
ploy said temperature settings accordingly for these models.

updating model weights (Brown et al., 2020).
For few-shot prompting, we manually created
and provided five few-shot examples per metric,
each containing a label, a set of excerpts, and a
justification for the assigned label. See Figure 9
for the zero-shot prompt and Figure 10 for the
few-shot prompt.

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Prompting
LLMs to generate a chain of thought and jus-
tify their reasoning has been shown to improve
performance in tasks (Wei et al., 2022; Mittal
et al., 2025; Jung et al., 2025a). Following this,
we prompt the LLMs to output a label, extract a
brief excerpt from the LLM-generated conversa-
tion, and provide a justification.

D.2. Evaluation Models

We evaluate state-of-the-art models from Ope-

and GPT-5-mini-2025-08-07 enable you to
specify the level of reasoning (e.g., minimal,
low, medium, high) instead of temperature.
Thus, we evaluate GPT-5-2025-08-07 and
GPT-5-mini-2025-08-07 at varying reason-
ing levels in comparison to the chat-focused
GPT-5-chat-latest model.

D.3. Evaluation Results

dataset, we use 100 conversations for model eval-

°’Due to cost, we cap Claude-Sonnet-4 at 2K output to-
kens plus 1,024 for extended reasoning, but impose no output
constraints on GPT-5 models, which are relatively cheaper.

remaining 60 conversations for additional robust-

performing configurations. The performance re-
sults of 5 selected LLMs on the gold-standard
dataset are shown in Tables 12, 13, 14, 15, and
16, with a summary of the best macro Fl-scores by
model in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, GPT-5-chat-latest con-
sistently performed better than other models, of-
ten using few-shot prompts. It achieved macro
Fl-scores between 0.748-0.967 and accuracies
between 0.75-0.97, validating the quality of our
prompts and the effectiveness of using LLMs for
our task. Its strongest performance was for To-
kenism, achieving a near-perfect accuracy of 0.97
and macro Fl-score of 0.967 using a zero-shot
prompt. Meanwhile, its weakest performance was
for Anticipated Ableism, achieving 0.76 accuracy
and 0.748 macro Fl-score.

System Persona: You are a social science expert specializing in ableism, harms, and identity
threats, including their covert manifestations in hiring conversations. Your task is to rigorously
evaluate and identify these subtle harms.

Evaluate the provided conversation between two hiring managers for the presence of the specified
[METRIC]. Use the supplied [METRIC] definition to guide your assessment.

Assign a LABEL:

- @: [METRIC] is completely absent.

- 1: [METRIC] is present in any form, including subtle or implicit indications. This includes
cases where one colleague debunks or opposes [METRIC], but another colleague subtly implies it:
such instances should still be marked as 1.

Support your decision with direct quotes from the CONVERSATION that demonstrate or refute the
presence of [METRIC]. Each quote should be relevant and directly tied to your reasoning. If there
are no supporting quotes, leave the EXCERPTS array empty.

Use the following format for your output (strictly as a JSON object, with keys in this order):
- LABEL (integer: @ or 1)

- EXCERPTS (array of direct quotes from the CONVERSATION, or empty array if none)

- JUSTIFICATION (string: concise explanation tied to the definition and excerpts)

Assign a label of @ ([METRIC] is completely absent) or 1 ([METRIC] is present, including subtle
undertones and implications), and provide justification for your label using direct quote(s) as
excerpts from the CONVERSATION. Use the [METRIC] definition below to evaluate the CONVERSATION.

with macro F1-scores of 0.728—0.917, 0.748—0.933,
and 0.701-0.910, respectively. Surprisingly, in-
creasing reasoning effort from minimal to low,
medium, or high often reduced performance for
both GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini (Tables 13, 14). This
decline, coupled with the weaker overall results of
reasoning models relative to GPT-5-chat-latest,
suggests that additional reasoning is counterpro-
ductive for labeling covert ableist bias and harmful
content.

For GPT-5-chat-latest, few-shot prompting
outperformed zero-shot prompting in nearly all
cases (with the exception of Tokenism). For ex-
ample, excluding Tokenism, GPT-5-chat-latest
saw macro Fl-score improvements of 0.019-0.122
when using few-shot prompts compared to zero-
shot prompts.

D.4 Robustness Evaluation

To further validate the reliability of our evaluation
and robustness of the best-performing model, we
conducted additional evaluations using the remain-

20

ing 60 examples from our 165 gold-standard con-
versations. Recall that we initially used 100 conver-
sations to systematically compare across models,
prompting strategies (zero-shot vs. few-shot), tem-
perature, and reasoning levels in order to identify
the best-performing configuration (§D.3).

With the optimal configuration determined—
GPT-5-chat-latest in the few-shot setting with
temperatures 0 or 0.2 for most metrics (see Ta-
ble 10 for selected configurations across ABLEIST
metrics)—we then applied this setup to the held-out
set of 60 conversations. As shown in Table 10, per-
formance remained consistently high, with macro
Fl-scores ranging from 0.783 to 0.877 across met-
rics. These results suggest that the selected model
and configurations are not overfit to the initial eval-
uation split, but instead generalize to new, unseen
annotations. This result demonstrates the reliabil-
ity and robustness of GPT-5-chat-latest for our
labeling task.

E Details on Model Finetuning

This section presents the training details ($E.1) and
evaluation results ($E.2) of the finetuned model,
designed for scientific reusability and preservation.

E.1_ Finetuning Details

Model: We trained our model using
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al.,
2024), with an adapter trained via Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021) to label
conversations across the ABLEIST metrics. We
selected this model for its relatively small, portable
size and because prior work shows that small
language models can rival or surpass larger ones
when fine-tuned for moderation tasks (Zhan et al.,
2025). LoRA further enables efficient fine-tuning
without updating all model parameters, making it

21

well-suited for adapting Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
to our specialized labeling task.

Data: We generated 2,820 conversations (§3.1), of
which 165 were annotated by expert authors to cre-
ate the gold-standard dataset (§3.3). The remaining
2,655 were labeled by GPT-5-chat-latest, the
best-performing LLM from the previous section,
across the ABLEIST metrics (§3.4.1). Synthetic
labels were split 90:10 into training and validation
sets, while the gold-standard dataset was held out
for testing.

Model Input and Output: The model input com-
prised three components: Instruction, Input, and
Response (Figure 11). The Instruction contained
the task description, definitions of the ABLEIST
metrics, and binary label descriptions, following
the zero-shot prompt design in Figure 9. We in-

Figure 11: Training prompt used to finetune Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. The model receives a generated conversation (in place
of the [input]), along with the definitions of the ABLEIST metrics (Table 2), following the zero-shot prompt design in Table 9.
It is instructed to evaluate the input conversation and output YAML-formatted binary labels for each metric. The model was
trained with masked instruction-following, where only the "Response" section contributes to loss during training. This enables
the model to learn to predict correct labels in YAML-format while ignoring the input context. The training ABLEIST labels in
the Response section was omitted at inference but used during training to compute the loss.

tentionally adopted this lean, zero-shot design for
computational efficiency and reusability. The In-
put was replaced with an LLM-generated conver-
sation, while the Response was replaced with the
ABLEIST labels in YAML-structured format.

Training used masked instruction-following,
where only the Response section contributed to
the loss during training. This enables the model to
learn to correctly predict the ABLEIST labels in
YAML-structured format while ignoring the input
context. The training ABLEIST labels in the Re-
sponse section was omitted at inference but used
during training to compute the loss.

The maximum input length was 2,048 tokens,
though no inputs exceeded this limit. The maxi-
mum output length was 512 tokens, sufficient for
producing labels for all eight ABLEIST metrics in
YAML format.

22

Training Parameters and Hardware: We trained
the model with the Adam optimizer (Kingma and
Ba, 2017) and cross-entropy loss. Following Un-
sloth (2025), we performed a grid search over
learning rates (2e-4, 5e-5, 5e-6) and LoRA ranks
(32, 64, 128), setting the LoRA Alpha equal to
the rank. Other parameters were fixed: batch
size (4 per device), gradient accumulation (1),
dropout (0), precision (bfloat16), weight decay
(0.01), max gradient norm (1), and warmup ratio
(0.1). We applied LoRA to all available modules
in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, used a cosine sched-
uler, and set the random seed to 42 for reproducibil-
ity. Training was conducted on 4 x NVIDIA L40
GPUs.

Training and Model Selection: We selected the
best model based on validation macro F1-score
across the ABLEIST metrics. The optimal hyper-


parameters were a learning rate of Se-5 and LoORA
rank of 128. The model converged in 3.5 epochs
with a training loss of 0.0013, achieving the highest
overall validation macro F1-score (0.9033).

are based on the human-annotated gold-standard
dataset (§3.3). The models achieves strong perfor-
mance, with validation macro Fl-scores ranging
from 0.919 to 0.979 across metrics. On the test set,
macro Fl-scores remain high—between 0.750 and
0.940 in the evaluation split and 0.707 to 0.907 in
the robustness split—demonstrating consistent and
high performance across the ABLEIST metrics.

Table 15: Performance of Claude-Sonnet-4-20250514 on labeling 100 conversations from the gold-standard dataset across 8
ABLEIST metrics, using zero-shot and few-shot prompts with varying temperature (for Extended Thinking, temperature of 1 is
required). We excluded the five few-shot examples from the evaluation and report Accuracy, Macro F1, Weighted F1, Precision,
and Recall. For Extended Thinking mode, we cap the model at 2K output tokens plus 1,024 for extended reasoning.
